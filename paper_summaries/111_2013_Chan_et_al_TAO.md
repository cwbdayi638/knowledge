Abstract
Using seismic activity and the Meishan earthquake sequence that occurred from 1904 to 1906, a scenario for short-term
probabilistic seismic hazards in the Chiayi region of Taiwan is assessed. The long-term earthquake occurrence rate in Taiwan
was evaluated using a smoothing kernel. The highest seismicity rate was calculated around the Chiayi region. To consider
earthquake interactions, the rate-and-state friction model was introduced to estimate the seismicity rate evolution due to the
Coulomb stress change. As imparted by the 1904 Touliu earthquake, stress changes near the 1906 Meishan and Yangshuigang
epicenters was higher than the magnitude of tidal triggering. With regard to the impact of the Meishan earthquake, the region
close to the Yangshuigang earthquake epicenter had a +0.75 bar stress increase. The results indicated significant interaction
between the three damage events. Considering the path and site effect using ground motion prediction equations, a probabilistic seismic hazard in the form of a hazard evolution and a hazard map was assessed. A significant elevation in hazards
following the three earthquakes in the sequence was determined. The results illustrate a possible scenario for seismic hazards
in the Chiayi region which may take place repeatly in the future. Such scenario provides essential information on earthquake
preparation, devastation estimations, emergency sheltering, utility restoration, and structure reconstruction.

1. Introduction
Due to the interaction between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates, many devastating earthquakes have taken
place in Taiwan (Wang and Shin 1998; Hsu 2003; Wu et
al. 2008; Cheng et al. 2012). The Chiayi region, located in
southwestern Taiwan with a high deformation rate (Yu et
al. 1997), has, in the past, been struck by several destructive
earthquakes. In 1792, a devastating earthquake struck the
Chiayi region which resulted in more than seven hundred
fatalities and eight thousand collapsed buildings (Cheng et
al. 2012). This earthquake can be attributed to the rupture
of the Mei
