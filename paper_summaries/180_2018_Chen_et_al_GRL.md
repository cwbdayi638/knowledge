Key Points:
• Relationship between shallow slow
slip events and seismicity is reported
at the southernmost Ryukyu Trench
for the ﬁrst time
• Spatiotemporal seismicity does not
adequately correlate with
propagation of slow slip but is
dominated by mainshock-aftershock
sequences
• High-pressure ﬂuid activity likely has
a key role in the initiation of episodic
slow slip events and subsequent
seismicity

Abstract Shallow slow slip events accompanied by seismicity has been increasingly reported in
subduction zones during the last decade; however, the relationship between shallow slip events and
seismicity is unclear. We report episodic slow slip events and seismicity at the southernmost Ryukyu Trench.
The inversion results from GPS-derived cumulative displacements indicate that the slow slip events occur
offshore in northeastern Taiwan on the shallow subduction interface, where high seismic VP/VS ratios applies.
Seismicity is observed above the subduction interface for locations of signiﬁcant variations in the VP/VS
ratio and does not follow the migration of peak slip along the subduction interface. We calculated the
temporal evolution between the seismicity and the propagation of slow slip events and determined that
seismicity is not primarily driven by slip propagation. The spatiotemporal relationship, coupled with the VP/VS
ratio, suggests that high-pressure ﬂuid activity may be crucial to episodes of slow slip events and seismicity.
Plain Language Summary Slow slip events are a member of the slow-earthquake family observed
by geodetic measurements in global subduction zones in the past 15 years. Shallow slow slip events are
considered to be important for the megathrust earthquake cycle of the shallowest locked zone. Recently,
shallow slow slip events accompanied by different seismic behaviors has been increasingly reported. This
paper reports episodic, shallow slow slip events accompanied by overlying plate seismicity at the
southernmost Ryukyu Trench and analyzes their relationship. We discover that the spatiotemporal
relationship between the propagation of slow slip and seismicity is weak, which infers that they may not have
