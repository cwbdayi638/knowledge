Abstract
A sequence of eruptions in the lower East Rift Zone (LERZ) of the Kilauea, Hawaii volcano commenced in early May
2018 and caused serious damage and residential evacuation. The post-eruption drainage and collapses of the summit
lava lake and caldera suggest a well-connected magmatic plumbing system along the rift zone. How and when the
pre-eruptive magmatic processes in such connecting system occurred are, however, still unclear. For that, we apply
ambient noise interferometry with seismic data from January 2017 to June 2018 from 12 broadband seismometers
to investigate spatiotemporal seismic velocity changes (dv/v) of the upper crust in the Kilauea area. The dv/v varia‑
tions in three frequency bands (0.3–0.6 Hz, 0.6–0.9 Hz, and 0.9–2.0 Hz) show distinct responses to strong earthquake
ground shaking and deep magmatic intrusion processes. Earthquake-induced dv/v drops mainly in the higher two
frequency bands imply shallow mechanical changes within the uppermost 1 km of the crust. In contrast, the magmarelated dv/v changes can be characterized into three periods of activity: from the December 2017 to March 15, 2018,
a dv/v excursion only seen in the lowest frequency band indicates the magmatic intrusion processes taking place at
the depth range of 1–4 km, consistent with the proposed depth of the magma reservoir-dike system in the rift zone.
The spatial dv/v distribution suggests that the magma may intrude to the deeper summit magma reservoir and in the
upper East Rift Zone (UERZ) at this time. From March 15 to April 17 in 2018, the summit inflation recorded by tiltme‑
ters causes the dv/v increases in the higher two frequency bands. After April 17 to the eruption, the accumulating
damage of the edifice together with the stronger intrusion activity in the UERZ result in dv/v decreases in all three
frequency bands around the summit and UERZ areas. Our observations highlight that the ambient noise interferom‑
etry analysis provides an opportunity to image and understand the pre-eruptive processes of reservoir-dike magma
system and could be a useful supplement to current volcanic monitoring systems.

Introduction
The lower East Rift Zone eruption of the Kilauea volcano

The 2018 eruption of the Kilauea volcano began in early
May and created a series of new fissures in the lower
East Rift Zone (LERZ, Fig. 1). The Hawaiian Volcano
Observatory (HVO) issued notices of magma pressurization at Pu‘u‘Ō‘ō on April 17 and lava overflowed from
