An MW 8.1 earthquake occurred in 2007 and induced a tsunami that hit the Western Solomon Islands and caused
casualties. This motivated us to deploy a seismic network around the rupture zone of the 2007 event. To investigate the seismic velocity structure of the Western Solomon Islands, we select seismograms of teleseismic
events recorded by our seismic network. Joint inversion of P-wave receiver functions and surface-wave group
velocity dispersion curves is used to estimate station-based 1-D velocity models. The resulting velocity models
show a highly variable crustal structure across the region. The Moho depths beneath the stations range from 25
to 40 km. A low-velocity zone (LVZ) is observed at most seismic stations in this work. Our study provides
preliminary station-based seismic velocity models for the study region, and more stations will be deployed in the
continuing project. An integrated 3-D velocity model will be determined in the future.

1. Introduction
The Solomon Islands is located in the southwestern Paciﬁc Ocean,
which is a complex boundary between the Paciﬁc, Australian, and
Woodlark plates (Fig. 1). Two large earthquakes occurred in 2007 and
2010, and both shock the Western Solomon Islands. The MW 8.1 event
of April 1, 2007, was the largest instrumentally recorded earthquake in
the Solomon Islands (Fritz and Kalligeris, 2008; Taylor et al., 2008;
Chen et al., 2009; Miyagi et al., 2009). The rupture zone of the 2007
event was approximately 245 km in length and extended from the San
Cristobal Trench and extends to the New Britain Trench (Taylor et al.,
2008). After three years, an MW 7.1 earthquake occurred and triggered
the tsunami that hit the local area (Newman et al., 2011; Kuo et al.,
2016). Both events caused injuries and deaths. Our group then planned
to deploy instruments around the rupture zone of the 2007 event to
perform seismological and geological investigations (Kuo et al., 2016;
Ku et al., 2018). Valuable data have been recorded from this project,
and the recording is still in progress.
