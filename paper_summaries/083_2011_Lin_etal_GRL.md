[1] We collected the strong‐motion accelerograms from
thirteen crustal earthquakes in Taiwan recorded by the
Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP)
stations to find the empirical relationship between the areas
of high initial P‐wave displacement and the corresponding
earthquake magnitudes. We found that the logarithm of the
area has a linear relation to the corresponding earthquake
magnitude in Mw for study earthquakes with magnitudes
between 5.4 and 6.5. We propose that this relationship might
be able to rapidly define earthquake magnitude without
knowing the earthquake location in regions with sufficient
seismic station coverage and might have practical application in earthquake early warning (EEW) and rapid reporting
systems. Citation: Lin, T.‐L., Y.‐M. Wu, and D.‐Y. Chen (2011),

1. Introduction
[2] Taiwan, located in the western part of the Pacific
Rim seismic belt, is situated in the collision boundary zone
between the Philippine Sea and Eurasian continental plates.
As a consequence, the seismicity in Taiwan is considerably
high. A large magnitude earthquake such as the 1999 Chi‐Chi
event could once again strike Taiwan and cause catastrophic
loss of life and massive economic damage. Over decades
of development in EEW, studies have shown that EEW is
a potential approach for real‐time seismic risk mitigation
[Kanamori et al., 1997; Teng et al., 1997; Wu and Teng,
2002; Allen and Kanamori, 2003; Kanamori, 2005].
Taiwan has been developing rapid reporting and EEW systems since a real‐time strong‐motion network was installed in
1995 by the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) [Wu
et al., 1997].
[3] The common EEW approach to find earthquake location is based on the traditional locating methods. The on‐line,
real‐time EEW location estimation merely uses fewer stations
(arrivals), which are selected near the source location in order
to speed up the collecting process without losing too much
accuracy. On the other hand, earthquake magnitude is
assumed to be correlated with the initial portion of the seismograms, mostly P‐wave. Limited by the incomplete arrivals
of the S‐wave signals, therefore, the magnitude estimation
inevitably possesses lower accuracy compared to the location
estimation.
