Centroid Fault-Plane Inversion in Three-Dimensional Velocity
Structure Using Strong-Motion Records
by Wei-An Chao, Li Zhao, and Yih-Min Wu

Abstract

The Chia-yi area in southwestern Taiwan is a region of relatively high
seismicity. Frequent earthquakes of various magnitudes in the shallow crust provide
valuable information for understanding the regional seismotectonic environment. In
this study, we use strong-motion records from the 22 October 1999, ML 6.4 Chia-yi
earthquake sequence to determine the focal mechanisms based on a criterion combining the P-wave polarity and the cross correlations between recorded and synthetic
waveforms. A recent 3D structural model for the study region is used, and to ensure
the computational efficiency, a database is established for the Green’s functions
obtained by the finite-difference method. Optimal focal depths and fault-plane solutions are obtained through a grid-search scheme driven by the genetic algorithm to
further improve the efficiency. We apply this approach to determine the focal mechanisms and centroid depths of the small and moderate events in the Chia-yi earthquake
sequence. Results show dominant strike-slip and thrust mechanisms that are in good
agreement with previous results based upon P-wave first-motion polarities and
moment-tensor inversions. This highly automatic and efficient approach will enable
the determination of focal depths and fault-plane solutions immediately following the
occurrence of small- to moderate-sized earthquakes.

Introduction
Taiwan is located at a plate boundary zone with complex
tectonic structures and high seismicity. The determinations
of frequently occurring regional earthquakes and their source
parameters are important to the understanding of regional
seismotectonics. In Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) monitors the regional earthquake activity by an array
of densely deployed networks consisting of a variety of
instruments, such as the Taiwan Strong-Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP, Liu et al., 1999) and CWB Seismic
Network (CWBSN, Shin, 1993) composed of strong-motion,
short-period, and broadband stations. The Institute of Earth
Sciences (IES) of Academia Sinica operates the Broadband
Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS) for a wide range of
seismological research (Kao et al., 1998). These networks
provide excellent seismic records for studying regional structure and earthquakes.
Since the inception of seismic networks in Taiwan in the
early 1990s, a large quantity of records have been accumulated from frequently occurring earthquakes around Taiwan,
which enabled numerous studies to be carried out on imaging
the 3D changes of the regional crustal and uppermost mantle
structures (e.g., Wu, 1978; Roecker et al., 1987; Rau and
Wu, 1995; Ma et al., 1996; Kim et al., 2005; Wu et al.,
2007; Wu, Chang, et al., 2009; Wu, Shyu, et al., 2009),
