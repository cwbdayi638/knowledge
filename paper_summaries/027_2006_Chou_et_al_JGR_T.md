[1] The termination of the Ryukyu trench against Eurasia and the oblique subduction of

the Philippine Sea plate create a subduction-collision complex offshore Taiwan, which has
not previously been elucidated in detail. We combine traveltime data from the seismic
networks in Taiwan and Japan to better illuminate how the subducting Ryukyu slab
deforms in this subduction-collision zone. More than 5000 events recorded by
both networks were relocated with the double-difference method using an optimal regional
one-dimensional velocity model. The offshore seismicity indicates that the double
seismic zone, with a gap of 15–20 km, exists in the subducting slab in the depth range of
40–80 km. Focal mechanisms suggest that the double seismic zone is caused by east-west
compression resulting from oblique convergence. The improved hypocentral locations
for the first time reveal folding of the slab into a horizontal curvature larger in magnitude
than and opposite in sign to that of the Ryukyu trench in the depth range 50–100 km. The
anomalous curvature, together with the focal mechanisms, suggests that the slab folds
against the Eurasian lithosphere and that this deformation cannot be fully elastic. We
model this deformation mode as the developing instability of a viscoelastic Maxwell layer
embedded in a viscous medium. The characteristic wavelength of the instability, i.e.,
250 km, is consistent with folding of a slab whose viscosity is 100 times higher than that
of the surrounding mantle for an along-strike elastic membrane strain as small as 0.01, or
more than 3 orders of magnitude higher if 5% elastic strain is allowed.

1. Introduction
[2] The global seismicity distribution provides a threedimensional (3-D) portrait of each subduction zone in the
mantle [e.g., Chiu et al., 1991; Engdahl et al., 1998]. These
images demonstrate that the subducting slab largely inherits
the geometric characteristics of the oceanic lithosphere
formed on the surface of the Earth and tends to avoid
additional extensibility or in-plane deformation [Burbach
and Frohlich, 1986; Yamaoka et al., 1986]. This implies that
for a slab thousands of kilometers in lateral dimension but
only tens of kilometers in thickness, the preferred mode of
deformation is flexure instead of in-plane deformation.
However, there are suggestions that flexure and large
