a b s t r a c t
Research at plate boundaries generally focuses on the kinematics of plate motions, the genesis of large
earthquake, and natural resources. However, often the present state of knowledge is still insufﬁcient to reveal
the details of such dynamic systems. To deﬁne in more detail the dynamics of, a major plate boundary fault the
Coastal Range Fault, eastern Taiwan, we use seismologic and geodetic data to unravel its subsurface geometry
and relevant fault behavior. By recomputing the archive triangulation datasets (1917–1978), and using a
dislocation algorithm, we determine that it consists of three segments. Our model results are consistent with
the observation of the 1951 M7.3 Hualien–Taitung earthquake sequence: that the southern two segments are
both oblique-slip faults with signiﬁcant thrust components, while the northern segment is a pure strike-slip
fault. According to our model each segment has the potential to produce an earthquake larger than M7.
However, based on GPS observations and seismic records, slip on the southern segment may take the form of
aseismic creep and multiple moderate earthquakes, rather than large events with long recurrence interval as
occur on the two more northerly segments. With regard to the central segment, the epicenter distribution of
catalogued earthquakes occurring after 1951 reveals the presence of a seismic gap, indicating that slip on this
segment is predominantly coseismic, with a correspondingly higher potential for large earthquakes in the
future.

1. Introduction
Located at a well-known plate boundary between the Philippine
Sea and Eurasia plates, where arc–continent collision began in the late
Miocene, the island of Taiwan is tectonically and seismically active
(Suppe, 1984; Tsai, 1986; Ho, 1986; Teng, 1990). Since active plate
boundary are the most dynamic tectonic setting on the earth, research
on the kinematics of plate motions, the genesis of large eart
