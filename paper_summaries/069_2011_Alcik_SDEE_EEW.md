Two recent catastrophic earthquakes that struck the Marmara Region on 17 August 1999 (Mw ¼ 7.4) and
12 November 1999 (Mw ¼ 7.2) caused major concern about future earthquake occurrences in Istanbul
and the Marmara Region. As a result of the preparations for an expected earthquake may occur around
Istanbul region, an earthquake early warning system has been established in 2002 with a simple and
robust algorithm, based on the exceedance of speciﬁed thresholds of time domain amplitudes and the
cumulative absolute velocity (CAV) levels (Erdik et al., 2003 [1]). In order to improve the capability of
Istanbul earthquake early warning system (IEEWS) for giving early warning of a damaging earthquake
in the Marmara Region, we explored an alternative approach with the use of a period parameter (tc)
and a high-pass ﬁltered vertical displacement amplitude parameter (Pd) from the initial 3 s of the P
waveforms as proposed by Kanamori (2005) [2] and Wu and Kanamori (2005) [3,4]. The empirical
relationships both between tc and moment magnitude (Mw), and between Pd and peak ground velocity
(PGV) for the Marmara Region are presented. These relationships can be used to detect a damaging
earthquake within seconds after the arrival of P waves, and can provide on-site warning in the Marmara
Region.

1. Introduction
Present technological advances in seismic instrumentation, in
digital communication and in computer technologies enable the
implementation of real-time earthquake monitoring systems.
Effective early warning systems for natural hazards are now
increasingly perceived as an integral component of disaster risk
reduction programmes. For this viewpoint, earthquake early
warning (EEW) is becoming a practical tool to reduce the losses
caused by a damaging earthquake by giving a few seconds to a
few tens of seconds warning before the arrival of a damaging
ground motion [5,6].
EEW systems, already in operation in several countries around
the world, have been using mainly two approaches; regional
warning and on-site warning. In the ﬁrst approach, the traditional
seismological
