Abstract
We in this study have calculated the standard normal deviate Z-value to investigate the variations in seismicity patterns in the
Taiwan region before and after the Chi-Chi earthquake. We have found that the areas with relatively high seismicity in the eastern
Taiwan became abnormally quiet before the Chi-Chi earthquake while the area in the central Taiwan with relatively low seismicity
showed unusually active. Such a spatially changing pattern in seismicity strikingly demonstrates the phenomenon of “seismic
reversal,” and we here thus present a complete, representative cycle of “seismic reversal” embedding in the changes of seismicity
patterns before and after the Chi-Chi earthquake.

1. Introduction
Taiwan is located on the western Circum-Pacific
seismic belt. In the vicinity of Taiwan, the Philippine
Sea plate subducts northward under the Eurasian plate
along the Ryukyu trench to the northeast of Taiwan,
whereas the Eurasian plate subducts eastward under the
Philippine Sea plate off the southern tip of Taiwan (Tsai
et al., 1977; Wu, 1978). Tectonically, most of the Taiwan
region is under NW–SE compression with a measured
convergence rate of about 8 cm/year (Yu et al., 1997).
The collision of those two plates causes the Taiwan area
many complex geological features and high seismicity
(Wang, 1998). Many disastrous earthquakes had occurred in this area in the past.

The 1999, MW 7.6, Chi-Chi earthquake is the largest
event on the Taiwan Island in the last century (Shin
et al., 2000; Chang et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2000; Teng
et al., 2001). It heavy struck the central Taiwan and
resulted in serious damage (Tsai et al., 2001; Wu et al.,
2002, 2003a, 2004). Solid star shown in Fig. 1 denotes
the epicenter of the Chi-Chi main shock and nearby lines
show its surface ruptures.
There was no any precursory phenomenon reported
before the occurrence of the Chi-Chi earthquake, although many retrospective studies related to various
precursory phenomena of this event can be found (e.g.
Chen et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2000, 2001; Akinaga et al.,
2001; Ohta et al., 2001; Chuo et al., 2002; Song et al.,
2003; Lee and Tsai, 2004;
