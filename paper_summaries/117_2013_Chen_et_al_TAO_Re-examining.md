ABSTRACT
On 26 February 2012, an inland ML 6.4 earthquake occurred near Wutai Township in Pingtung County, Taiwan and
caused massive shaking in southern Taiwan. After the 2010 ML 6.4 Jiasian earthquake caused extensive damage in southern
Taiwan, deep, complicated structures were revealed. This earthquake provided us an opportunity to further investigate related
tectonic issues and hazard mitigation. Although the focal mechanisms of the Wutai earthquake from various institutes’s readings were quite consistent, a large uncertainty was present with regard to focal depth. The relocated source parameters suggest
a deeper depth of 32.3 km and a focal mechanism of a 326° strike, a 35° dip, and a 57° rake. Based on the tectonic seismic
profile in southern Taiwan, the hypocenter of the Wutai earthquake is therefore likely located in the lower crust and implied
that the deep blind fault system under the southwestern Central Range could even go deeper southward, revealing complicated thick-skinned tectonics. In addition, due to the abundance records of the P-wave first-motion polarities collected, we
also tested the feasibility of searching the source depth by a polarity fitting for which we demonstrated several synthetic tests
and showed its strength. In applying the polarity fitting method to the real case of Wutai earthquake, the results indicated that
this approach may be affected by the uncertainty of the epicenter sensitively. However, the application showed the potential
that a large number of polarity data existing in earthquake catalog does not only dedicate to determine the focal mechanisms
conventionally but may also contribute to the source location in the future.

1. INTRODUCTION
Following the 2010 ML 6.4 Jiasian earthquake, the ML
6.4 Wutai earthquake occurred on 26 February 2012 was a
moderate inland earthquake (ML > 6) which further rattled
southern Taiwan. The epicenter at 22.75°N and 120.75°E,
and a focal depth of 26.3 km were reported by the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB). The largest peak ground acceleration value reached 160 cm s-2, corresponding to a CWB intensity scale of V (80 - 250 cm s-2) in Taiwan (Wu et al.
2003a). The Taiwan Hi
