Abstract:
This research accomplished by the descriptive statistics and spectral analysis of six kinds of time series data gives a complete
assessment of periodic fluctuation in significant constituents for the Huakang Shan earthquake monitoring site. Spectral analysis
and bandpass filtering techniques are demonstrated to accurately analyse the significant component. Variation in relative ground
water heads with a period of 12Ð6 h is found to be highly related to seawater level fluctuation. Time lag is estimated about
3Ð78 h. Based on these phenomena, the coastal aquifer formed in an unconsolidated formation can be affected by the nearby
seawater body for the semi-diurnal component. Fluctuation in piezometric heads is found to correspond at a rate of 1000 m h1 .
Atmospheric pressure presents the significant components at periods of 10Ð8 h and 7Ð2 h in a quite different type, compared
to relative ground water head and seawater level. Copyright  2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Many hydrogeological phenomena change periodically
with time. Common cases include: changes in ground
water level caused by infiltration from surface water,
ground water level variation caused by tidal effect from
rivers or coasts nearby, and ocean tides affected by the
interaction between astronomical planets. For aquifers
adjacent to an ocean, a river, or a lake, the ground water
table fluctuates with the change in water level in the
nearby surface water (Cooper et al., 1965; Bredehoeft,
1967; Maas and De Lange, 1987; Roistaczer, 1988; Erskine, 1991; Shih et al., 1999, 2000; Shih, 1999a,b, 2000,
2002; Shih and Lin, 2002, 2004). As such, data of the disturbed ground water levels, upon application of relevant
boundary conditions, can be expressed mathematically by
using the spectral relationships through time-frequency
domain of tidal effects. With this approach, the spectral characteristics of field data can be used to solve
for hydraulic diffusivity as a ratio of transmissivity and
storage coefficient (Shih, 1999a,b; Shih and Lin, 2004).
Therefore, it is an alternative approach to study aquifer
parameters in a large scale by using data from a relevant
setting of boundary conditions and water level fluctuation
in observation wells.
