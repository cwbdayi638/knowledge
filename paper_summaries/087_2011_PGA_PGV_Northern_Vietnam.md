a b s t r a c t
The ﬁrst attenuation relationships of peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV) for
northern Vietnam are obtained in this study. Ground motion data are collected by a portable broadband
seismic network in northern Vietnam as a part of cooperation between the Institute of Geophysics, Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology, Vietnam and Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica,
Taiwan. The database comprises a total of 330 amplitude records by 14 broadband stations from 53 shallow earthquakes, which were occurred in and around northern Vietnam in the period between 01/2006
and 12/2009. These earthquakes are of local magnitudes between 1.6 and 4.6, focal depths less than
30 km, and epicentral distances less than 500 km. The new attenuation relationships for PGA and PGV
are:

log10 ðPGAÞ ¼ 0:987 þ 0:7521ML  log10 ðRÞ  0:00475R;

log10 ðPGVÞ ¼ 3:244 þ 0:9008ML  log10 ðRÞ  0:00322R;
where PGA is in cm/s2, PGV is in cm/s, and R is the epicentral distance in kilometers. The site corrections
are also derived in this study. These site corrections are very suitable with the station corrections for ML
and imply the qualiﬁcation of the resulting attenuation relationships.

1. Introduction
Vietnam is located in South East Asia and bounded by the Paciﬁc belt and Mediterranean–Himalaya seismic belt on its eastern,
western and southern sides, respectively. Vietnam is strongly affected by the relative movement between the belts, and also suffers the consequence of the spreading process that is taking place
in East Vietnam Sea. The dynamic tectonic processes are dragging
the territory of Vietnam and adjacent areas into intensive movements in a variety of directions and making the regional tectonic
structure very complicated. The tectonic conditions ha
