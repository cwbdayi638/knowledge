Application of Waveform Stacking to Low-Cost
Local Earthquake Early Warning Arrays
in Taiwan
by Cheng-Yung Tasi, Ting-Li Lin, and Yih-Min Wu
INTRODUCTION
Taiwan has been constantly threatened by large, damaging
earthquakes as the tectonic consequence of persistent collisions between the Philippine Sea plate and Eurasian plate.
Use of an earthquake early warning (EEW) system is one of
the effective tools for seismic-hazard mitigation and has operated in many countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Mexico,
and the United States (e.g., southern California) (Kanamori
et al., 1997; Allen et al., 2009; Lee and Wu, 2009; Satriano
et al., 2011). Taiwan initiated the development of EEW after
the Hualien offshore earthquake (M w 7.8) occurred on 15
November 1986. This earthquake caused large losses of life
and property due to basin amplification in the metropolitan
Taipei area, with an epicentral distance of 120 km. A timely
warning can be announced to the highly populated Taipei city
if an EEW system in the Hualien area can provide the earthquake information within 20 s (i.e., travel time of crustal
shear wave over a distance of 120 km).
There are two types of EEW system: (1) the front-type
warning, which collects the seismic records close to the epicenter and dispatches the earthquake warning to a more-distant
area, has higher accuracy than the onsite one because of the use
of more stations and longer time window; (2) the onsite-type
warning has a smaller reporting time but lower accuracy because it relies on only one or a few stations.
The backbone of the present Taiwan EEW system is the
Rapid Earthquake Information Release System (Wu et al.,
1997, 2000) operated by a government agency, the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB), since 1995. This system, consisting
of 109 telemetered seismic stations, is operated in the fronttype warning mode. This system can provide earthquake information mostly within 20 s following an earthquake occurrence
(Wu and Teng, 2002; Hsiao et al., 2009, 2010).
A high density of seismic stations is always in great
demand for EEW and earthquake rapid reporting networks
(Lin and Wu, 2010a,b; Lin et al., 2011). Increasing the number
of stations used in the front-type early warning can improve
estimate accuracy of earthquake parameters and might shorten
the warning reporting time.
An experimental EEW system consisting of microelectromechanical systems-type accelerometers (Holland, 2003),
called “Palert” sensors (Fig. 1), has started operating on

June 2012 in Taiwan (Wu et al., 2013; Wu and Lin,
2014). Because of the successful results of the experimental
Hualien Palert EEW network (Wu and Lin, 2014), the Palert
devices have been installed all over Taiwan. Following three
years of installation, over 500 Palert stations now are deployed and configured (Wu et al., 2013). Another advantage
of the Palert sensor is its low cost compared with other seismometers; it is less than one-tenth the
