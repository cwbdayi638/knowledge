Abstract Statistical studies on earthquake recurrence time probabilities have frequently
been applied to seismic hazard analyses. In Taiwan, an instrumental catalog provides a good
opportunity to examine statistical attributes of earthquakes around the study region, with the
objective to evaluate the seismic risk and earthquake potential for hazard mitigation. With
the completeness of recordings, seismic rates for small-to-moderate magnitudes can be
obtained. An elimination of aftershocks was performed using a double-link cluster analysis
method. The time intervals between a series of events (the inter-occurrence periods) are
stationary with an identical temporal distribution. Based on the goodness-of-fit testing
between a few models and observation, we suggested the use of the Gamma distribution in
modeling this variable, earthquake inter-occurrence periods, for the study region.
Accordingly, unified relationship was constructed, and statistical limitations of sparse
sampling for devastating earthquakes (such as M C 6.0 or 7.0) could be resolved. The
empirical result evaluated by introducing the conditional probability indicates that the
recurrence probability of a M C 7.0 earthquake is 78.8 % within 10 years in Taiwan region.
