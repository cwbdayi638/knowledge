Abstract
The Mw 6.3, 21 February 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand, earthquake is regarded as an aftershock of the M 7.1, 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake. However, it caused severe damage in the downtown Christchurch. Such a circumstance
points out the importance of an aftershock sequence in seismic hazard evaluation and suggests the re-evaluation of a seismic
hazard immediately after a large earthquake occurrence. For this purpose, we propose a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA), which takes the disturbance of a short-term seismicity rate into account and can be easily applied in comparison
with the classical PSHA. In our approach, the treatment of the background seismicity rate is the same as in the zoneless approach, which considers a bandwidth function as a smoothing Kernel in neighboring region of earthquakes. The rate-and-state
friction model imparted by the Coulomb stress change of large earthquakes is used to calculate the fault-interaction-based
disturbance in seismicity rate for PSHA. We apply this approach to evaluate the seismic hazard in Christchurch after the occurrence of the M 7.1, 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake. Results show an increase of seismic hazards due to the stress
increase in the region around the rupture plane, which extended to Christchurch. This provides a suitable basis for the application of a time-dependent PSHA using updating earthquake information.

1. Introduction
The city of Christchurch is the largest city on the South
Island of New Zealand and is the second-largest urban area
in the country. Since few active faults in its vicinity were
identified formerly (Stirling et al. 2002), previous studies (Smith and Berryman 1986; Stirling et al. 1998, 2002,
2008) concluded a low seismic hazard. Surprisingly, the
M 7.1, 4 September 2010 Darfield earthquake, 40 km west
of Christchurch, caused the largest peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 0.3 g in Christchurch as recorded by GeoNet
