Abstract The annual maximum earthquake magnitudes around Taiwan from 1900 to
2009 are presented in this paper. Using the distribution of the AMEM, a probabilistic
framework to estimate the recurrence probability of a large-size earthquake is also proposed and an illustration was made in this paper. The mean value of the 110-AMEM is
6.433, and the coefficient of variation is around 10%. The results of two goodness-of-fit
tests show that the Gamma and lognormal distributions are relatively suitable to represent
the AMEM around Taiwan among five common probability distributions. Using the proposed approach, the recurrence probability is 4% for an earthquake with magnitude greater
than 7.5 in a 1-year period around Taiwan. More site-specifically, the probability is around
5% in Central Taiwan for such an earthquake to occur in a 50-year period.

1 Introduction
Taiwan is located at the plate boundary where the arc-continent collision occurs between
the Luzon volcanic arc at the west edge of the Philippine Sea plate and the Chinese
continental margin of the Eurasian Plate (Suppe 1984). The tectonic setting has produced
the island of Taiwan where 23 million people reside as of today. As a result of the regional
tectonic movements, most of Taiwan is under a northwest–southeast compression at a
convergence rate of about 8 cm/year (Yu et al. 1997). The Taiwan orogeny, starting around
