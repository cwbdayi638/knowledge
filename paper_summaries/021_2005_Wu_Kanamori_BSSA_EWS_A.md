Experiment on an Onsite Early Warning Method for the Taiwan
Early Warning System
by Yih-Min Wu and Hiroo Kanamori

Introduction
As increasing urbanization is taking place worldwide,
earthquake hazards pose serious threats to lives and property
in urban areas. For seismic hazard mitigation, a practical
earthquake forecast method appears to be far from realization, because of the extreme complexity involved in earthquake processes (e.g., Kanamori et al., 1997). Another approach to mitigate seismic hazards is the development of
early warning systems (EWS) (Nakamura, 1984, 1988; Heaton, 1985; United States National Research Council, 1991;
Teng et al., 1997; United States Geological Survey, 1998;
Wu et al., 1998; Wu and Teng, 2002; Allen and Kanamori,
2003). An EWS provides a few seconds to tens of seconds
of warning time for impending ground motions, allowing for
mitigation measures in the short term. Early warning systems
that estimate the severity of ground shaking and its onset
time are in operation in Japan (Nakamura, 1984, 1988,
1989), Mexico (Espinosa-Aranda et al., 1995), and Taiwan
(Teng et al., 1997; Wu et al., 1998, 1999; Wu and Teng,
2002). This timely information can be used to minimize
property damage and the loss of lives in urban areas. It can
also be used for real-time loss estimation to aid emergency
response and recovery (Wu et al., 2002).
Two types of EWS are in operation around the world.
One is a front-detection EWS: seismometers installed in the
earthquake source area give early warnings to more distant
urban areas. Nakamura (1984) introduced the first practical
system for the Japanese train system. The Taiwan and Mexico systems are examples of this type. The other is an onsite EWS, which determines the earthquake parameters from
the initial portion of the P wave and predicts the more severe
ground shakings of the following S-wave trains. The urgent
earthquake detection and alarm system (UrEDAS) (Nakamura, 1988, 1989) is an example of this type. A prototype
system, ElarmS (Allen and Kanamori, 2003) also uses this
method.
In most front-detection systems, S waves are used for
the determination of earthquake magnitude. While this
method provides accurate magnitude determinations, the determination of earthquake parameters has to wait until the
arrival of the S waves. For example, the Taiwan Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) uses a front-detection system and
requires an average of 22 sec to determine earthquake parameters with magnitude uncertainty of Ⳳ0.25. It provides
a warning for areas beyond about 70 km from the epicenter.
In contrast, UrEDAS and ElarmS both use the predominant

period from the initial 2–4 sec of P waves to determine the
magnitude for EWS, and the method described by Grecksch
and Kumpel (1997) estimates the magnitude from the first
second of the P wave recorded on accelerograms. However,
large uncer
