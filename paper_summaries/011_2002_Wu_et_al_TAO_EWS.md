ABSTRACT
Having the ability of near real-time damage assessment would benefit
earthquake emergency response operations in Taiwan greatly. Thus, we
established an empirical method of assessing the near real-time damage
using the rapid reporting system in Taiwan. Relationships between peak
ground velocity and damage rates (fatality rate, total and partial household collapsing rates) during the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake were determined
in this study. The distribution of the peak ground velocity can be mapped
within minutes of post-initiation of a strong earthquake by the rapid reporting system of the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (Wu et al. 2001). By
correlating peak ground velocity with damage rates gathered by the rapid
reporting system, a near real-time damage assessment can be issued, in
addition to the epicenter, magnitude and intensity.

1. INTRODUCTION
Located on the western circum-Pacific seismic belt with a plate convergence rate of 8 cm/
year (Yu et al. 1999), Taiwan had experienced numerous destructive earthquakes with severe
casualties and property losses. The potential earthquake hazard will continue to increase along
with the population growth. Therefore, it is essential for Taiwan to seek means through scientific research to reduce future earthquake hazards.
Taiwan established several research programs actively pursing on earthquake rapid reporting system. A Taiwan Rapid Earthquake Information Release System (TREIRS) using a
real-time strong-motion accelerograph network consisting 82 stations distributed around Taiwan were established by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) (Fig. 1). Recent findings had
