Abstract
The Mw = 6.8 Chengkung earthquake on December 10, 2003 in eastern Taiwan was associated with abundant aftershocks. To
explore the seismogenic mechanism and its causative fault system, we relocated the aftershocks, determined the focal mechanisms from
P-wave polarities and used the Finite Dimension Source Model method to identify the fault plane. Based on our results, the earthquake
can be divided into three seismic clusters: one is located in the east of the southern Longitudinal Valley, one on the Chihshang fault, and
the other on the western side of the Luyeh fault to the south. Both the seismic distribution and Finite Dimension Source Model method
show that east-dipping fault planes with thrust mechanisms coincide with previous studies based on background seismicity. The third
seismic cluster suggests thrust mechanism along west-dipping fault plane that was not recognized by background seismicity. This seismic
cluster occurred along the Central Range Fault previously proposed as active by geomorphic and geologic evidence.

1. Introduction
The Chengkung earthquake (Mw = 6.8) occurred on
December 10, 2003 at a focal depth of 10.0 km, as reported
by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB). The main shock
occurred at 23.10°N and 121.34°E along the eastern coast
of Taiwan near the town of Chengkung (Fig. 1a). The
region also experienced damage to structures during the
November 24, 1951 Taitung earthquake (Mw = 7.0). The
Taitung earthquake caused 17 casualties and damages to
1016 houses (Hsu, 2003). In contrast, the 2003 Chengkung
earthquake resulted in slight damage of buildings and constructions of nearby harbor facilities, leading to limited
property loss. After the main shock, thousands of aftershocks occurred, including 11 ML P 5.0 events that took

The Longitudinal Valley (LV) of eastern Taiwan
marks the suture zone of an arc-continent collision, producing an active orogeny that began to develop in the
late Miocene (Ho, 1986; Teng, 1992). The current stress
ﬁeld determined by GPS shows that the major principle
stress is oriented 308° (
