[1] The 2003 Chengkung earthquake (Mw 6.8) provided
diagnostic evidence for a source model showing the
deformation process of the seismogenic Chihshang fault
in eastern Taiwan. The aftershocks show a fault-bend at a
depth of 18 km. Coseismic ground displacements recorded
by strong-motion records allow us to deduce instant
rupturing of this event. Our resulting model shows a
fault length of 33 km and dip-slip dominant rupture on
fault-plane deeper than 18 km. Estimated coseismic
displacements constrain two fault planes: one at 5 – 18 km
depth dipping 60°E and 18– 36 km depth dipping 45°E. The
uppermost fault-plane of the Chihshang Fault (0 – 5 km) did
not break immediately after the main shock; however, it
may have a major role in after-slip and even interseismic
ground deformation. The Taiyuan basin developed in the
hanging wall is a geomorphic feature consistent with and
adequately explained by coseismic ground displacements.

1. Introduction
[2] Large earthquakes commonly occur in eastern Taiwan
due to the vigorous arc-continent collision with a converging rate of 7 to 8 cm/year [Suppe, 1981; Ho, 1986; Tsai,
1986; Angelier et al., 1997, 2000] (Figure 1). The fault
system in the Longitudinal Valley (LV) is one of the sutures
in the collision zone and it is characterized by high
seismicity [Tsai, 1986; Shyu et al., 2005]. Two dominant
thrust faults, i.e., the Central Range fault (CNF) and Coastal
Range fault (COF), bound the mountain fronts of the
Central Range and Coastal Range (CR) (Figure 1) [Biq,
1965; Angelier et al., 1997, 2000; Lee et al., 2001, 2003].
Using the data of the earthquake sequence of the 2003
Chengkung earthquake (Mw 6.8, On Dec. 10), this paper
analyzes the southern segment of the COF, namely the
Chihshang fault (CSF; Figure 1). Both geological and
