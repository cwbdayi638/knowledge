Abstract Since 1990, digital strong-motion accelerographs and global positioning system (GPS) instruments have been widely deployed in the Taiwan region
(Shin et al. 2003; Yu et al. 2001). The 1999 Chi-Chi,
Mw 7.6 earthquake and the 2003 Chengkung, Mw 6.8
earthquake were well recorded by both digital accelerographs and GPS instruments. These data offer a
good opportunity to determine coseismic displacements from strong-motion records and to compare the
results with those derived from GPS measurements.
As noted by Boore (2001), a double integration of the
acceleration data often leads to unreasonable results,
and baseline corrections are therefore required in most
cases before the integration. Based on the works of
Iwan et al. (1985) and Boore (2001), we developed an
improved method for baseline correction and validated it using an extensive set of data from shake-table
tests of a known “step” displacement on 249 accelerographs. Our baseline correction method recovered
about 97% of the actual displacement from the shaketable data. We then applied this baseline correction
method to compute coseismic displacements from the

strong-motion data of the Chi-Chi and Chengkung
earthquakes. Our results agree favorably with the
coseismic displacements determined by the GPS measurements at nearby sites. The ratio of seismic to
geodetic displacement varies from 0.78 to 1.41, with
an average of about 1.05.

1 Introduction
In 1991, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) of
Taiwan undertook a 6-year Taiwan Strong-Motion
Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) to deploy over 600
digital accelerographs on free-field sites and an
equivalent number of accelerographs in buildings
and on bridges (Shin et al. 2003). With a station
spacing of a few kilometers (except in unpopulated
high-mountain areas), all felt earthquakes in Taiwan
have been well recorded by the TSMIP network. In
particular, the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake (Mw=7.6) in
central Taiwan was the best-recorded major earthquake in the 20th century, and the data were quickly
released by the CWB (Lee et al. 1999, 2001).
The frequency response of a digital accelerograph
is nominally flat in translational acceleration from DC
to about 50 Hz. If there is no coseismic deformation
at the accelerograph site and if the background and
instrumental noises are low, the time histories of
