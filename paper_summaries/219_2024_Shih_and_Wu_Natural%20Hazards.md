Abstract
This study delves into the critical realm of natural hazard preparedness by examining
building vibrations after Taiwan’s Chi-Chi earthquake (1999). By meticulously analyzing
the monitored displacement of a building pre- and post-catastrophe, we unveil a notable
correlation between the building’s proximity to the hypocenter and subsequent changes
in period and damping as earthquake magnitudes escalate. Based on these insights, we
have devised a robust regression model to accurately estimate optimal periods using peak
ground acceleration values. Our research provides a pragmatic assessment of a building’s
innate vibration characteristics, crucial for long-term seismic monitoring, with a focus on
an attic-basement system. The findings offer a fresh perspective on how buildings respond
to catastrophic earthquakes, shedding light on their resilience. Moreover, this study demonstrates the feasibility and practicality of evaluating a building’s vibration evolution through
comprehensive historical strong motion data. Our work provides valuable insights for
future maintenance and safety considerations, ensuring steadfast structural integrity in the
face of natural hazards.

1 Introduction
Taiwan, situated along the western Circum-Pacific seismic belt, experiences significant
tectonic activity. The convergence of the Philippine Sea plate beneath the Eurasian plate
at the Ryukyu trench and the eastward subduction of the South China Sea lithosphere
under the Philippine Sea plate contribute to intense crustal deformation and faulting
