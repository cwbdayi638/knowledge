A Virtual Subnetwork Approach to Earthquake Early Warning
by Yih-Min Wu and Ta-liang Teng

Abstract Progress has been made toward the goal of earthquake early warning in
Taiwan. By applying the concept of a virtual subnetwork (VSN) to the Taiwan Central
Weather Bureau seismic network, the earthquake rapid-reporting time has been reduced to about 30 sec or less by a new system called VSN. This represents a significant step toward realistic earthquake early-warning capability. The VSN system described here was put into operation from December 2000 to June 2001. A total of
54 earthquakes (100% correct detection) were detected and processed successfully
during this period. Comprehensive earthquake reports are issued mostly in less than
30 sec, with an average of about 22 sec after the origin time. The 22-sec reporting
time will offer more than 20 sec of early-warning time to cities at distances greater
than 145 km from the source, for which the shear-wave strong-shaking arrival time
is about 44 sec. This 20 sec is an adequate amount of time to carry out numerous
preprogrammed emergency-response measures prior to the arrival of strong shaking.
Introduction
Located on the western circum-Pacific seismic belt with
a measured plate-boundary-convergence rate of about 8 cm/
yr, Taiwan has been repeatedly hit by damaging earthquakes.
Some of the damaging events have inflicted severe casualties
and property losses. For example, on 17 March 1906 a damaging earthquake (M 7.1) occurred in Chiayi (1,258 casualties, 2,385 injuries, 6,767 houses destroyed, and 15,218
houses damaged; Hsu, 2001). In 1935 a disastrous earthquake (M 7.1) occurred in the Hsinchu-Taichung area (3,276
casualties, 12,053 injuries, 17,907 houses destroyed, and
37,781 houses damaged; Hsu, 2001). The 1999 Chi-Chi
earthquake (MW 7.6) occurred in Nantou County (2,456 casualties, 11,306 injuries, with $4 billion in property damage).
This seismic loss potential will continue to exist and in fact
will increase as the population grows. It is therefore crucial
for Taiwan (and for many other parts of the world subject
to seismic hazard) to seek means through scientific research
to offset future earthquake losses.
Because of the extreme complexity involved in earthquake processes, reliable earthquake prediction is not
currently possible (Kanamori et al., 1997). Present technological advances in seismic instrumentation, digital communication, and processing permit the implementation of a
real-time earthquake-monitoring system. This system should
be able to perform the functions of both rapid reporting and
early warning (United States National Research Council,
1991). In Taiwan, research programs on earthquake rapidreporting systems (RRS) and early-warning systems (EWS)
are being actively pursued. Some recent findings show that
the RRS and EWS are becoming promising tools that can be
made reliable enough to provi
