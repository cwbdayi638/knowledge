Abstract In the present work, ground motion is estimated
from future scenario earthquakes at different sites in
Uttarakhand Himalayas in India using empirical Green’s function (EGF) technique. The recorded ground motion from April
4, 2011, Mw 5.4 earthquake is taken as a basic element. The
ground motion is estimated at 24 sites, where the element
earthquake was recorded. It is observed from synthesized time
histories that sites located near the epicenter may expect accelerations in excess of 1 g. In the present analysis, Dharchula
can expect ground accelerations in excess of 1 g. For Mw 7.0,
the expected peak values of acceleration (Amax) and velocity
(Vmax) on horizontal components at different sites range between 11 and 912 gal and 5 and 52 cm/s, respectively. The
corresponding values for the Z component range between 8
and 228 gal, and 3 and 14 cm/s, respectively. Similarly, for Mw
7.5, the expected Amax and Vmax on horizontal components at
different sites range between 25 and 1281 gal and 25 and
102 cm/s, respectively. The corresponding values for the Z
component range between 14 to 474 gal, and 15 to 70 cm/s,

respectively. The site amplification functions are estimated
using the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio procedure.
Zone IV (on a scale of II to V according to the seismic zonation map for India) response spectrum for 5 % damping is
deficient for Mw 7.0, while zone V response spectrum is
exceeded at several frequencies for same magnitude. For Mw
7.5, zone IV response spectrum is conservative (except at
some frequencies), while zone V response spectrum is
exceeded at many sites. The estimated PGA values can be
incorporated in marking the weak areas in the central
Himalaya, thereby assisting the designing and construction
of new structures.

Introduction
Continuing collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates
has given rise to the great Himalaya. The long Himalayan
mountain region keeps on generating a few great and several
moderate earthquakes every century. This region has experienced six great
