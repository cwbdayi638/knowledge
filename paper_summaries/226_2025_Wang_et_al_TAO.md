Abstract
Rapid assessment of potential landslides in regions of risk and their associated impacts following an earthquake
is needed to provide crucial information to guide emergency responses. After the 2025 M6.4 Dapu earthquake
in southern Taiwan, we applied a combined analysis of Newmark displacement and a decision tree model to rapidly
identify slopes with a high potential for failure. Then, the coseismic landslide inventory taken in the weeks follow‑
ing the Dapu earthquake was compiled from satellite images in conjunction with field photographs. In total, 45
landslides were identified. According to the available near-real-time earthquake shaking proxies and landslide inven‑
tories, most landslides occurred within the 250 gal, 15 cm/s and 0.3 cm contour lines of earthquake shaking associ‑
ated with peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV) and peak vertical displacement of 3-s P waves
(Pd3), respectively. In addition, we found that a peak vertical displacement (Pd) larger than 0.3 cm is a good indica‑
tor for identifying coseismic landslides and can provide sufficient lead times (LTs) of 3–5 s for emergency response.
Our work can serve as a basis for advancing conventional susceptibility assessment after an earthquake occurrence
to achieve a coseismic landslide early warning (CoLEW) system.

1 Introduction
Coseismic landslides, which are one of the most common
geologic hazards triggered by earthquakes, can cause
extensive damage and result in significant economic
losses and casualties (Keefer, 1994). To better understand

the patterns of occurrence and factors influencing coseismic landslides, the method for predicting landslide susceptibility, which provides the probability of landslide
occurrence in a given area and is helpful for rapidly
assessing landslide hazards, has been widely developed in
recent decades (Guzzetti et al. 1999; Lee 2014; Nowicki
