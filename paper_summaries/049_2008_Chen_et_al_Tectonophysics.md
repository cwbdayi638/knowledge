We propose a new variant of the sandpile model, the long-range connective sandpile model, by means of
introducing randomly internal connections between two separated distant cells. The long-range connective
sandpile model demonstrates various self-organized critical states with different scaling exponents in the
power-law frequency-size distributions. We found that a sandpile with higher degree of randomly internal
long-range connections is characterized by a higher value of the scaling exponent for the distribution,
whereas the nearest neighbor sandpile is possessed of a lower scaling exponent. Our numerical experiments
on the long-range connective sandpile models imply that higher degree of random long-range connections
makes the earthquake fault system more relaxant that releases accumulated energy more easily and
produces fewer catastrophic events, whereas lower degree of long-range connections possibly caused by
fracture healing very likely motivates accelerating seismicity of moderate events.

1. Introduction
Many geophysical phenomena are scale invariant and exhibit the
power-law distribution (Turcotte, 1997; Dodds and Rothman, 2000),
which is the only statistical distribution not including a characteristic
scale. A striking example is the Gutenberg–Richter relation for the
frequency–magnitude statistics of earthquakes. The scaling exponent
and its associated variation is then a matter of fundamental
importance in such power-law distribution. Speciﬁcally, in the study
of seismicity evolution, the scaling exponent in the Gutenberg–Richter
relation, which is well known as the b-value, has been very often
discussed in the literature and considered as a monitoring index
related to the forthcoming large earthquakes (Smith, 1986; Urbancic
et al., 1992; Wiemer and Wyss, 1994; Henderson et al., 1994; Guo and
Ogata, 1995; Legrand et al., 1996; Wyss, 1997; Lapenna et al., 1998;
Henderson et al., 1999; Barton et al., 1999; Oncel and Wilson, 2004;
Wyss et al., 2004; Mandal et al., 2005; Wu and Chiao, 2006
