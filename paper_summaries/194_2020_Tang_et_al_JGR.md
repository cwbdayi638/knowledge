Key Points:
• Coupled viscoelastic ﬂow and
afterslip explain the 8 years of
postseismic deformation following
the El Mayor‐Cucapah earthquake
• The effective viscosity in the lower
crust is heterogeneous over space
and time
• The mechanical response of the
lower crust includes nonlinear
transient creep transitioning to
steady‐state dislocation creep

Abstract The rheology of the crust and mantle and the interaction of viscoelastic ﬂow with
seismic/aseismic slip on faults control the state of stress in the lithosphere over multiple seismic cycles.
The rheological behavior of rocks is well constrained in a laboratory setting, but the in situ properties of the
lithosphere and its lateral variations remain poorly known. Here, we access the lower‐crustal rheology in
Southern California by exploiting 8 years of geodetic postseismic deformation following the 2010 El
Mayor‐Cucapah earthquake. The data illuminate viscoelastic ﬂow in the lower crust with lateral variations
of effective viscosity correlated with the geological province. We show that a Burgers assembly with dashpots
following a nonlinear constitutive law can approximate the temporal evolution of stress and strain rate,
indicating the activation of nonlinear transient creep before steady‐state dislocation creep. The transient and
background viscosities in the lower crust of the Salton Trough are on the order of ~1018 and ~1019 Pa s,
respectively, about an order of magnitude lower than those in the surrounding regions. We highlight the
importance of transient creep, nonlinear ﬂow laws, and lateral variations of rheological properties to capture
the entire history of postseismic relaxation following the
