a b s t r a c t
The Taiwan orogen sitting at the pre-rifted Eurasian margin and bracketed by two sub-orthogonal
subduction systems is subject to complicated geotectonics, motivating numerous seismic tomographic
studies in local and regional scale. Most of them obtained P-wave velocities (Vp), or with Vp/Vs ratio
jointly, but few were for S-wave velocities (Vs). With unprecedented amount of S-wave data, in this
study a new set of well-tuned Vp, Vs, and Vp/Vs models were determined by an elaborate joint-inversion
scheme, integrating the data of P- and S-wave travel times, S–P times, and the borehole logging data (for
near-surface correction) into one system. This allowed us to revisit the subduction-collision process in
detail by comparing Vp, Vs, and Vp/Vs ratio simultaneously. With enhanced slab imaging of Philippine
Sea Plate (PSP) under northeast Taiwan, we are able to discriminate the plausible missing Luzon forearc
basement along the plate boundary and propose a “skateboarding” edge model, in which the westernmost
PSP rides on the east-subducted forearc basement and subducts northward underneath the Eurasian
lithosphere. The underlain forearc basement along with the PSP subduction then results in the anomalous
shallow double seismic zone observed only near Taiwan Island. Meanwhile, at around 121◦ E the northsubducting PSP seems dipping west to collide with the deep Eurasian lithosphere, shaping an irregular
corner wedge structure. In addition, we evaluate our model with previous ones by waveform modeling
approach and show the current performance of travel-time tomography in Taiwan region.

1. Introduction
The Taiwan orogen created by the oblique arc-continent collision between the Eurasian plate (EP) and the Philippine Sea plate
(PSP) is situated at the junction of two trenches with opposite subduction polarities (Fig. 1). To the east the Ryukyu trench is where
the PSP subducts northward beneath the EP while t
