SUMMARY
We explore a practical approach to earthquake early warning in southern California by determining a ground-motion period parameter τc and a high-pass filtered displacement amplitude
parameter Pd from the initial 3 s of the P waveforms recorded at the Southern California Seismic Network stations for earthquakes with M > 4.0. At a given site, we estimate the magnitude
of an event from τc and the peak ground-motion velocity (PGV ) from Pd. The incoming threecomponent signals are recursively converted to ground acceleration, velocity and displacement.
The displacements are recursively filtered with a one-way Butterworth high-pass filter with a
cut-off frequency of 0.075 Hz, and a P-wave trigger is constantly monitored. When a trigger
occurs, τc and Pd are computed. We found the relationship between τc and magnitude (M) for
southern California, and between Pd and PGV for both southern California and Taiwan. These
two relationships can be used to detect the occurrence of a major earthquake and provide onsite
warning in the area around the station where onset of strong ground motion is expected within
seconds after the arrival of the P wave. When the station density is high, the methods can be
applied to multistation data to increase the robustness of onsite early warning and to add the
regional warning approach. In an ideal situation, such warnings would be available within 10 s
of the origin time of a large earthquake whose subsequent ground motion may last for tens of
seconds.
Key words: earthquake early warning, magnitude, P-waves, seismic hazard mitigation.

In the past decade, progress has been made towards implementation
of earthquake early warning (EEW) in Japan, Taiwan, and Mexico
(e.g. Nakamura 1988; Espinosa-Aranda et al. 1995; Wu et al. 1998;
Wu & Teng 2002; Odaka et al. 2003; Horiuchi et al. 2005, 2006a).
Two approaches have been adopted: (1) regional warning and (2)
Onsite warning. The first approach is the traditional seismological
method in which data from a seismic network are used to locate
an earthquake, determine the magnitude, and estimate the ground
motion in the region involved. In (2), the beginning part of the
ground motion (mainly P wave) observed at a site is used to predict
the ensuing ground motion (mainly S and surface waves) at the
same site. In this case, it is not necessary to locate the event and
estimate the magnitude, although in some systems the hypocentre
