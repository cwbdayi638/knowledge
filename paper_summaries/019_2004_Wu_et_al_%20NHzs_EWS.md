Abstract. A better real-time assessment of earthquake effects (i.e. seismic intensity estimation)
is crucial for hazard mitigation. Especially during the aftermath of a disastrous event, significant
reduction of loss can usually be realized through timely execution of emergency response measures. These effects include strong-ground shaking, ground failure, and their impact on man-made
structures. The descriptive Modified Mercalli intensity scale, though still in common use in many
poorly instrumented areas of the world, is out of date in areas of extensive strong-motion instrumentation. It is desirable to place the earthquake intensity scale on a more quantitative basis based on
the actual recorded ground-motion shaking and carefully compiled damage records. In this paper,
we investigated the relationships between earthquake loss, intensity and strong motion peak values,
mainly based on the Chi-Chi earthquake. Both the strong-motion peak values and the earthquake loss
are related. From the results, we found that peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak acceleration
response spectra at 1 s period (1 s Sa) values are two parameters that give slightly higher correlation
coefficients than other parameters for earthquake loss analysis. For intensity estimations, the peak
ground velocity (PGV) values and 1 s Sa values are better parameters in the high range and PGA is
not stable for smaller earthquakes. Although PGV values give a slightly lower correlation coefficient
and larger standard deviation in seismic loss analysis during the Chi-Chi earthquake, it nevertheless
gives more reliable instrumental intensity over a broad magnitude range. 1 s Sa is a good parameter
for both seismic losses and intensity evaluation. We thus conclude that PGV and 1 s Sa are relatively
more stable in damage assessment and, at least in the high end, in intensity estimation. We shall
incorporate these findings in our real-time earthquake rapid reporting and early warning systems.
Key words: seismic hazard mitigation, seismic damage assessment, peak ground motion, earthquake
rapid reporting system.

1. Introduction
Real-time strong motion monitoring is becoming an important tool for seismic
hazard mitigation (Kanamori et al., 1997; Teng et al., 1997; Wu et al., 1997). In
Taiwan both an earthquake rapid reporting system and an earthquake early warning
system have been developed by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), and were
placed in routine operation as early as 1995 (Teng et al., 1997;
