SUMMARY
Earthquake-related groundwater level changes have been recorded by a dense network of
monitoring well stations in Taiwan. At most multiple-well stations, the direction and magnitude
of coseismic water level changes vary in wells of different depths. Comprehensive water
level data recorded in 209 wells in the vicinity of the seismogenic fault during the 1999
M L 7.3 earthquake demonstrate a preliminary 3-D distribution of coseismic changes. The
largest coseismic rise at a station observed typically in a confined gravel aquifer indicates
the association of the magnitude of coseismic change with characteristics, rather than depth,
of the aquifer. The variation of coseismic changes in the vertical direction implies possible
inconsistency between the observed water level changes and the volumetric strains calculated
from simple dislocation models. At a given hypocentral distance, the coseismic change in the
footwall of the ruptured segment of the fault was much greater than that of the unruptured
segment. This phenomenon suggests that fault displacement plays an important role in the
generation of coseismic changes. While hypocentral distance correlates well with coseismic
rise or fall in the vicinity of the ruptured seismogenic fault, poor correlation is found for
coseismic change further from the earthquake epicentre.

Groundwater level can be changed abruptly during earthquakes, particularly in the seismically active area. As groundwater level in a
confined aquifer may change in response to tidal strain, it has been
considered as an indicator of crustal strain due to earthquake activities (Bredehoeft 1967). Moreover, change of groundwater level is
thought to have the potential of searching signals of fault movement
or crustal deformation before earthquakes (King et al. 2000).
Coseismic changes of groundwater level have been observed in
many places in the world (Wakita 1975; Roeloffs 1988; Kissin
& Grinevsky 1990; Rojstaczer & Wolf 1992; Ohno et al. 1997;
Leonardi et al. 1997; Grecksch et al. 1999; King et al. 1999; Chia
et al. 2001). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain
changes of water level in wells during earthquakes, such as static
strain of aquifers, seismic shaking of deposits, fracturing of bedrock
and permeability change at the site (Mo
