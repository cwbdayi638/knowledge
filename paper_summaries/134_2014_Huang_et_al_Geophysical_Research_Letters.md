Abstract The interaction between two ﬂipping subduction systems shapes the complicated lithospheric
structures and dynamics around the Taiwan region. Whether and in what form the Eurasian Plate
subducts/deforms under Taiwan Island is critical to the debate of tectonic models. Although an east
dipping high-velocity anomaly down to a depth below 200 km has been reported previously, its detailed
morphology remains uncertain and leads to different interpretations. With a two-step strategy of nonlinear
joint inversion, the slab images of the Eurasian Plate were retrieved in a geometry that is hyperthin in the
south, becoming massive and steeper in the central, and severely deformed in the north. The possible
depth and dimension of a slab break were also investigated through synthetic tests of whether the slab
had torn. Moreover, the slab deﬂection found at ~23.2°N latitude seems to correspond to where the
nonvolcanic tremors and recent NW-SE striking structures have occurred in southern Taiwan.

1. Introduction
The Taiwan orogeny created by the convergence between the Eurasian Plate (EP) and the Philippine Sea Plate
(PSP) is intricately bracketed by two suborthogonal subduction systems (Figure 1a). The PSP to the east is
subducting northward to the EP along the Ryukyu trench, whereas to the south, the EP is subducting under the
PSP eastward at the Manila trench, creating a distinct subduction ﬂipping system. Although the morphology of
the PSP and the EP offshor
