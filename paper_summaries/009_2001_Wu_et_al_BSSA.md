Near Real-Time Mapping of Peak Ground Acceleration and
Peak Ground Velocity Following a Strong Earthquake
by Yih-Min Wu, Tzay-Chyn Shin, and Chien-Hsin Chang

Abstract During a disastrous earthquake, the early assessment and timely reporting of the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV) maps
will be crucial in an effective emergency response operation. In this study, we first
derive an empirical relationship between ML and MW. The PGA and PGV attenuation
relationships are deduced with data from the Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation
Program (TSMIP) and the Taiwan Rapid Earthquake Information Release System
(TREIRS). Site corrections of the attenuation relationships for shallow and large earthquakes in Taiwan region are also obtained. Peak values of earthquake strong ground
motion can be well determined in Taiwan as soon as the earthquake location is
determined, and magnitudes are calculated by the TREIRS. This peak ground motion
value information can be immediately turned into the calculated PGA and PGV maps
that can be issued within two minutes of the earthquake origin time. During any
disastrous earthquake, these maps are found to be very useful for immediate seismic
damage assessment and dispatching of emergency response missions.
Introduction
Real-time seismic monitoring, especially for strong
earthquakes, is an important tool for seismic hazard mitigation (Kanamori et al., 1997; Teng et al., 1997). It provides
valuable near–real-time information for rapid earthquake
emergency response, thereby mitigating the loss. With the
importance of rapid earthquake information for seismic hazard mitigation being recognized, efforts to design and implement systems to provide a broad range of rapid earthquake information have recently been expanded (Heaton,
1985; Nakamura, 1988, 1989; Espinosa-Aranda, et al., 1995;
Gee et al., 1996; Wu et al., 1997, 1998, 1999; Wald et al.,
1999a,b). During the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake a
severe test was put on the Taiwan Rapid Earthquake Information Release System (TREIRS) system (Shin et al., 2000;
Wu et al., 2000). For the purpose of briefness, we use the
term T system to mean the TREIRS in this article. We also
report our experience and thoughts in the development and
application of the T system.
The most common information available immediately
following a damaging earthquake is its magnitude and epicenter. However, the damage pattern is not a simple function
of these two parameters alone. More detailed information is
needed for emergency response agencies to assess the situation for better details and accuracy. For example, for the
20 September 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake, the city of
Tung-Shih Town is in the region with the worst damage,
even though it is about 50 km from the epicenter (Fig. 1).
Thus, it is highly desirable to map out distributions of peak

ground acceleration (PGA) and peak gr
