Key Points:
• A 3-D model of seismic P wave
anisotropy beneath Taiwan
is presented
• The anisotropy in the crust delineates
geological structures in eastern
Taiwan
• Anisotropy reveals collision-induced
displacements below the crust
of Taiwan

Abstract We present a 3-D anisotropic seismic model of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the
Taiwan region based on the tomographic inversion of traveltime data from regional earthquakes. In the
crust beneath eastern Taiwan, we observe coast-parallel anisotropy that perfectly delineates the major
geological structures. In westernmost Taiwan, we distinguish a crustal block corresponding to the Peikang
High at the margin of the Eurasian Plate, where coast-perpendicular anisotropy within a high-velocity
anomaly is observed. In the uppermost mantle, the direction of anisotropy beneath central Taiwan turns
perpendicular to the coast, which may indicate eastward underthrusting of the Peikang Block that was
induced by collisional processes. To the NE of Taiwan, the anisotropy forms circular patterns coinciding
with the shape of the Ryukyu arc, which may reﬂect the distribution of the deformations and fractures in
the accretion and arc complex.

1. Introduction
Taiwan is a singular point on the world tectonic map at which the Philippine Sea Plate (PSP) collides with the
Eurasian Plate (EAP) in two subduction zones with nearly opposite orientations [e.g., Suppe, 1984; Teng, 1990;
Koulakov et al., 2014], where intensive collisional processes are concentrated in a relatively small area. This
collision created sharp topography contrasts (Figure 1a) and complex geological structures (
