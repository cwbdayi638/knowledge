1. Introduction
Taiwan is located on the Circum-Pacific seismic belt. On the
east side of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea plate subducts beneath
the Eurasian plate at the Ryukyu trench, while at the south end of
Taiwan, the South China Sea lithosphere subducts eastward
under the Philippine Sea plate. The active convergent margin,
connecting these two subduction zones, is characterized by rapid
crustal deformation, regional-scale crustal faulting, and high
seismicity. The densely populated western Taiwan, with highrise buildings as a consequence of developing economy, is
vulnerable to increasing earthquake hazard. Therefore, earthquake research has a high priority in Taiwan and considerable amounts of resources have been devoted to seismic instrumentation in general, and strong-motion instrumentation in
particular.
Many disastrous earthquakes have occurred in the past, the
most recent one being the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake (Teng et al.,
2001). About 2500 people died and 300,000 were left homeless.
The importance of strong-motion instrumentation has long been
recognized, and we will summarize here the history of the strongmotion instrumentation programs in Taiwan. The earlier instrumentation programs were conducted primarily by the Institute of
Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, and have been mostly research
oriented (Tsai, 1997; see also Report of the Institute of Earth
Sciences under China (Taipei) in Chapter 79). The later efforts,

involving an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of
instruments, were conducted primarily by the Central Weather
Bureau.

2. Strong-Motion Instrumentation
Program by IES
2.1 Strong-Motion Accelerographs
Network (SMA)
An islandwide strong-motion network was deployed by the
Institute of Earth Sciences (IES), Academia Sinica, beginning
in 1974, and by 1983, this network consisted of 72 stations.
The instruments used were the standards at that time, i.e., the
SMA-1s. The first strong-motion record obtained by this network was in April 1976. The purpose of this network is mainly
to study earthquake source, structure responses, attenuation of
ground motions, and risk analysis. By 1990, accelerographs of
this network increased to 79, as a mix of analogy and digital
recording units. Most of them were installed on free-field sites,
while some were on the man-made structures. Most of those
free-field stations were installed on the populous plain areas.
After 1990, all sta
