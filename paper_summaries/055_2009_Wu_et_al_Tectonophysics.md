We combine the arrival time data from eleven ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) and from permanent
stations of the Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN) and the Taiwan Strong Motion
Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) to improve the three-dimensional Vp and Vp/Vs structures in the Taiwan
region, relocate hypocenters of earthquakes in southern Taiwan including the 2006 Pingtung Earthquake
sequence, and determine the focal mechanisms of some of the larger events. Our tomography result suggests
that in the region south of Taiwan the Eurasian continental lithosphere is being subducted beneath the
oceanic Philippine Sea plate, leading to a region of low P-wave speed with seismicity on top of a relatively
high P-wave speed zone. The hypocentral distribution of the Pingtung Earthquake sequence indicates that
the ﬁrst event in the initial two largest shocks was a normal-faulting quake caused by the bending of the
subducting lithosphere. The second event, perhaps triggered by the ﬁrst one, was a strike-slip earthquake.

1. Introduction
The Pingtung Earthquake sequence started on December 26, 2006.
The ﬁrst shock occurred at 12:26 UTC (20:26 local time). According to
the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) catalog, the epicenter is
located at 21.67°N and 121.56°E, off the southwest coast of Taiwan
(Fig. 1), with a focal depth of about 44 km and a magnitude of ML = 7.0
[Mw = 7.0 in the Harvard centroid-moment tensor (CMT) catalog]. It
was followed by another big event 8 min later at 21.97°N and 121.42°E,
about 36 km to the north–northeast of the ﬁrst shock, with a
magnitude of ML = 7.0 (Mw = 6.9 in the Harvard CMT catalog) and a
focal depth of 50 km. These two large events of comparable size
occurring in a very close spatial and temporal proximity formed a
doublet (e.g., Lay and Kanamori, 1980). This doublet event caused 44
injuries, including 2 fatal ones, 3 building collapses, and the rupture of
submarine communications cables (National Disaster Prevention and
Protection Commission, R.O.C., 2007).
