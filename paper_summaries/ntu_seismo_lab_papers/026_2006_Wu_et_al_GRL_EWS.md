[1] Prompted by recent success in the research and
application of earthquake early warning systems, we
conducted an investigation into the relationship between
the magnitudes of earthquakes and the properties of the first
three seconds of the P waves at a single station. Using
waveforms at station NACB of the Broadband Array in
Taiwan for Seismology from 46 earthquakes within 100-km
epicentral distance, we found a linear correlation between
the magnitudes and the logarithmic characteristic periods of
the initial P waves for earthquakes up to magnitude 6.5.
We also detected a deterministic relationship between the
magnitudes and the peak amplitudes of the initial P waves
for earthquakes of magnitude M < 6.5. While further study
needs to be done on the behavior of the initial P-wave
peak amplitudes from larger earthquakes, we propose here
that the characteristic periods and peak amplitudes of the
first three seconds of the P waves be used jointly in onsite
(single-station) earthquake early warning operations.

1. Introduction
[2] In the past few years, research on earthquake early
warning (EEW) has undergone a rapid development [Wu
and Teng, 2002; Allen and Kanamori, 2003; Kanamori,
2005; Wu and Kanamori, 2005a, 2005b; Olson and Allen,
2005]. At present EEW is becoming a useful tool for
practical real-time seismic hazard mitigation, with applications in Japan [Nakamura, 1988; Horiuchi et al., 2005],
Taiwan [Wu and Teng, 2002], and Mexico [EspinosaAranda et al., 1995].
[3] The critical point of EEW is determining the overall
size of an earthquake, and thus the expected strong ground
motion, from the first few seconds of the P wave. Whether
this determination is possible rests on whether there are
differences in the onsets of earthquakes of different sizes,
which is ultimately controlled by the physics of the
earthquake rupture process. A prevalent hypothesis for the
earthquake rupture propagation is the so-called ‘‘cascade
model’’. In such a model, an earthquake rupture starts with a
slip on a small fault patch and continues to grow along the
fault plane as long as the conditions are favorable [Brune,
1979; Ellsworth and Beroza, 1995, 1998; Kilb and
