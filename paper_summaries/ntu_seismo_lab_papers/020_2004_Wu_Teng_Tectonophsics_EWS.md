Abstract
We introduce an empirical method of near real-time, near-field magnitude determination for large (MN6.5) crustal
earthquakes. Time integration over the strong shaking duration on the absolute values of the acceleration records is carried out
for nearby stations surrounding many large earthquake sources in Taiwan. The integrated quantity, here denoted as total
effective shaking, is used in a regression process to derive an empirical relationship for a quick Mw determination useful for a
reliable real-time operation in earthquake rapid reporting and earthquake early warning systems (EWSs).

1. Introduction
A large earthquake may be excited by a propagating rupture or by jumping dislocations, and may have
a source dimension on the order of 100 km or more.
The larger the earthquake is, the heavier the loss
potential will be. From the standpoint of seismic
hazards mitigation, it is imperative for a seismic
network to determine as quickly as possible the
location and magnitude (therefore the shaking inten-

sity) of a large earthquake in order to quickly assess
the potential damage and to timely offset the shakeinduced secondary hazards. For this purpose, the
Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN)
of Taiwan has instigated a Rapid Reporting System
(RRS) (Teng et al., 1997; Wu et al., 1997, 2000), and
an earthquake early warning system (EWS) has also
been put into operation (Wu and Teng, 2002). These
systems are quickly becoming one of the promising
tools in earthquake loss mitigation. The RRS and
EWS issue critical information (hypocenter, magnitude, and intensity) within about a minute or less after
the event occurrence, and transmit the information to
populated areas and other locations of sensitive
facilities, particularly to the emergency response
