Modern technology allows real-time seismic monitoring facilities to evolve into earthquake early
warning (EEW) systems, capable of reducing deaths, injuries, and economic losses, as well as of
speeding up rescue response and damage recovery. The objective of an EEW system is to estimate in a
fast and reliable way the earthquake’s damage potential, before the strong shaking hits a given target.
The necessary framework for EEW implementation is provided by the observed relationships
between different parameters measured on the signal onsets and the ﬁnal earthquake size. The
implication of these observations on the physics of fracture processes has given rise to a signiﬁcant
debate in the seismological community.
Currently, EEW systems are implemented or under testing in many countries of the world, and
different methodologies and procedures have been studied and developed. The leading experience of
countries like Japan or Mexico shows that, with a proper education of population and end-users, and
with the design of real-time systems for the reduction of vulnerability/exposure, EEW can be an
effective approach to the mitigation of the seismic risk at short time-scales.

1. Introduction
Earthquakes are among the most damaging events caused by
the Earth itself. As urbanization progresses worldwide, earthquakes pose serious threat to lives and properties for urban areas
near major active faults on land or subduction zones offshore.
The mitigation of the seismic risk is a complex task, which
requires the cooperation of scientists, engineers and decision
makers, and that has to be approached at different time scales
([1,2]; Fig. 1). These range from years, where long-term forecast
and scenarios should drive the improvement of urban planning
and building codes, to months or weeks, when anomalous
seismicity patterns can rise the level of alertness in a certain
area, down to the short term (days to hours), where the
availability of reliable predictions of size, location and time of
an incoming earthquake would be required.
However, the processes of earthquake preparation and generation are extremely complex and our observations cover a
relatively short period compared to large earthquake cycles. As a
