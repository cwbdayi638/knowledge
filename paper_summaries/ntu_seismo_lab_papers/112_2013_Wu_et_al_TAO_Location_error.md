Abstract
Signals from ten explosions were used to examine earthquake location uncertainty in Taiwan. Location errors for explosion sites determined using a relocation process were expressed in terms of statistical measurements for standard errors in
the depth (ERZ), the epicenter (ERH), the root-mean-square of the travel time residuals (RMS), and the station coverage gap
(GAP). In general, for this study, major factors in location errors resulted from the poor coverage of seismic stations (e.g., a
large value of GAP). Using the relationship between location errors and parameters from the explosion location assessment,
uncertainties for earthquake locations in the Taiwan region for a total of 384064 events from 1991 to 2011 were evaluated.
Offshore regions in southwestern and northeastern Taiwan had larger location errors. For the inland locales, location errors
in longitude, latitude, and depth were approximately 3.1 ± 2.7, 1.3 ± 1.6, and 4.6 ± 3.9 km, respectively. The uncertainties
estimated from this study could offer a good reference for other related studies.

1. INTRODUCTION
The uncertainty of earthquake locations is an important
factor in seismological studies especially for identifying
seismogenic structures and accessing seismic losses caused
by earthquake damage (Wu et al. 2002). Reliable earthquake
locations depend on the quality of seismic-wave records’
spatial distribution of recording stations, reliability of crustal and upper mantle velocity structures, and the methodology used to locate earthquakes. Statistical measurements of
standard errors, the ERZ (the error in the vertical), and the
ERH (the error in the horizontal) are commonly calculated
in earthquake location programs (Flinn 1965; Lee and Lahr
1975; Chang et al. 2000). However, the importance of these
two measurements is generally overlooked (Flinn 1965).
Taiwan is located at the plate boundary between the
Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates which have very complicated fault systems with a spacing of just a few kilometers. When considering seismic hazards mitigation in rapid
