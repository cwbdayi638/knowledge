INTRODUCTION
On 4 March 2010, the JiaSian earthquake (MW = 6.0 and
ML = 6.4) struck southern Taiwan. It was the largest earthquake in the region in nearly fifty years, since the 1964 Paiho
earthquake (ML = 6.3). According to the damage report by the
Taiwan National Fire Agency, there were 96 people injured, but
thankfully no deaths. However, hundreds of buildings, including school buildings, were required to be immediately evaluated
for structural safety. The hypocenter of the 2010 JiaSian earthquake is shallow (about 23 km, given by the Central Weather
Bureau [CWB], Taiwan) and is located within less than a few
tens of kilometers to populated areas (Kaohsiung and Tainan
counties) on its western side, coinciding with the direction of
the mainshock rupture (Figure 1). Therefore, the JiaSian earthquake provides an opportunity to examine the performance of
the current earthquake early warning system (EEWS) operated
by CWB and also test two new proposed magnitude estimation methods in the EEWS (Lin and Wu 2010a, 2010b).
The two most commonly adopted types of EEWSs at
the present time are regional and onsite warning systems. In
regional EEWSs, the ground shaking characteristics (either P
or S waves) recorded by seismic sensors or a network close to the
epicenter are used to calculate the earthquake hypocenter and
magnitude and then to estimate strong ground motions at distant target areas. For onsite EEWSs, the initial P-wave motion
is used to predict the ground motions of the later S and surface
waves (which commonly have higher amplitudes or destructive
energy than that of the initial P-wave motion) at the same site.
Generally, the onsite EEWS is faster but less accurate than the
regional EEWS (Wu and Kanamori 2005a, 2005b).
A sub-network method based on the regional EEWS
approach has been in operation for practical real-time earthquake monitoring since 2001 in Taiwan (Wu et al. 1999; Wu
and Teng 2002; Hsiao et al. 2009). The pre-configured sub-network is a subset of the Rapid Earthquake Information Release
System (RTD; Wu et al. 1997, 2000). The RTD network con1. Department of Geosciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei

sists of 109 seismic stations, and each station is equipped with a
three-component, force-balance accelerometer (Figure 2). The
whole Taiwan region is divided into five sub-networks, and
each sub-network consists of 32 RTD stations (Figure 2). The
fundamental argument behind the sub-network method is that
empirically the determinations of the event location and magnitude with a practically sufficient accuracy are mostly controlled by the stations close to the epicenter (less than 60 km)
in EEWS. The average response t
