[1] The northeastern region of Taiwan is one of the few places on Earth that experienced a
transition from collision to subduction and back-arc opening in a young orogenic belt. This
provides us a rare opportunity to study the structural characteristics in such a transition.
We attempt to analyze the seismicity and stress patterns in this transitional region using
data obtained from a dense and high-quality seismic network. Our results show that from
south to north, fault types change from thrust to strike-slip, then to normal faulting. The
transitional domain between Ilan and Hualien is dominated by left-lateral strike-slip
faulting with a NNW-SSE minimum principal stress axis, consistent with the opening of
the Okinawa Trough. To the north, the Ilan Plain is formed by structural activities of a
series of normal fault systems. To the south, the spatial distribution of an earthquake cluster
north of Taiwan’s Coastal Range appears to parallel the subducting interface between the
Philippine Sea and Eurasian plates. This implies the northern extension of the Coastal
Range has subducted. Consequently, the opening of the Okinawa Trough becomes an
important tectonic driving force in northeastern Taiwan. The westernmost Ryukyu arc is
pushed by the opening Okinawa Trough, and moves southward. The northern part of
Taiwan’s Central Range moves with the arc to bend southeastward, and the Ilan Plain
forms in the space north of the range. The bending of the Central Range belt results in
bedding plane slip with left-lateral strike-slip earthquakes in the transitional domain
to accommodate the deformation.

1. Introduction
[2] The Taiwan orogen is produced by the ongoing
oblique collision between the NE-SW trending Chinese
continental margin of the Eurasian plate (EP) and the mostly
N-S trending Luzon volcanic arc of the Philippine Sea plate
(PSP) since about 5 Ma [Ho, 1986; Teng, 1990; Shyu et al.,
2005a]. This oblique collision initiated from northern
Taiwan and propagated southward as the Luzon volcanic arc
approaches and collides. In this process, the Luzon volcanic
arc acts as the backstop and impinges the accretionary
wedge, resulting in the deformation of the accretionary
wedge and the orogenesis.
