Proposed in the late 1980s, cumulative absolute velocity (CAV) is a new intensity measure for earthquake
ground motion characterizations, followed by studies and applications such as CAV ground motion prediction
equations (GMPEs). In this study, two new CAV GMPEs were developed with 24,667 strong-motion records from
Taiwan, and the ﬁrst CAV seismic hazard assessment for Taipei (the most important city in Taiwan) was then
conducted using the local CAV models. It shows that the annual rate for the study area to encounter a ground
motion with CAV > 0.97 g-sec is 0.002 per year, corresponding to a 10% occurrence probability in 50 years. By
contrast, the deterministic scenario-based analysis shows that the CAV seismic hazard is about 0.60 g-sec for the
study area. Future studies are worth conducting to develop more sophisticated, local CAV GPMEs and to explore
more applications of such CAV prediction models, such as the developments of PGA-CAV joint probability
distributions for conducting PGA-CAV joint seismic hazard assessments.

1. Introduction

aﬀected. For better addressing the issue, EPRI led a research project
studying the correlation between structural damages and several IMs;
then based on 250 earthquake records, CAV was found as the most
suitable indicator/predictor to structural damage among the IMs examined [8].
According to EPRI, the mathematical formulation of CAV was deﬁned as follows [8]:

Earthquakes generate random ground motions governed by a
variety of uncertainties (e.g., source mechanisms, wave propagation
path, site condition, topography, etc.). In order to characterize the intensity of an earthquake, many intensity measures (IMs) were proposed
[1], such as peak ground acceleration (PGA) and response spectral acceleration (SA) that are commonly used for earthquake-resistant design.
For estimating the levels of PGA/SA during earthquakes, ground motion
prediction equations (GMPEs) were developed and calibrated with instrumental data [e.g., Refs. [2–7]]. For example, several PGA GMPEs
were developed based on the NGA (Next Generation of Ground-Motion
Attenuation Models) database [2–5], with others developed based on
local data from Greece and Taiwan [6,7].
