Abstract This study first presents the series of peak ground acceleration (PGA) in the
three major cities in Taiwan. The PGAs are back-calculated from an earthquake catalog
with the use of ground motion models. The maximums of the 84th percentile (mean ? one
standard deviation) PGA since 1900 are 1.03, 0.36, and 0.10 g, in Taipei, Taichung, and
Kaohsiung, respectively. Statistical goodness-of-fit testing shows that the series of PGA
follow a double-lognormal distribution. Using the verified probability distribution, a
probabilistic analysis was developed in this paper, and used to evaluate probability-based
seismic hazard. Accordingly, given a PGA equal to 0.5 g, the annual exceedance probabilities are 0.56, 0.46, and 0.23 % in Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung, respectively; for
PGA equal to 1.0 g, the probabilities become 0.18, 0.14, and 0.09 %. As a result, this
analysis indicates the city in South Taiwan is associated with relatively lower seismic
hazard, compared with those in Central and North Taiwan.
Keywords Probability-based seismic hazard  Double-lognormal distribution  Three
