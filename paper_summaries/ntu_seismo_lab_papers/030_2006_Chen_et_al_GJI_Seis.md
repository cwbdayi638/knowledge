The relationship between the b-value of the Gutenberg–Richter relation and the fractal dimension D of earthquakes is a widely discussed topic during the last three decades (e.g. Aki 1981; King 1983;
Turcotte 1986; Hirata 1989; Wang 1991; Volant & Grasso 1994; Oncel et al. 1996; Lapenna et al. 1998; Henderson et al. 1999; Legrand
2002; Wyss et al. 2004; Mandal & Rastogi 2005). Since Aki (1981)
proposed a simple relationship between the b-value and the fractal
dimension with a positive correlation D = 3b/c (where c is the
slope of log moment versus magnitude relation and is about 1.5),
both the positive (e.g. Guo & Ogata 1995; Legrand 2002; Pascua
et al. 2003; Oncel & Wilson 2004) and negative (e.g. Hirata 1989;
Henderson et al. 1994; Oncel et al. 1996; Wang & Lee 1996) correlations between those two scaling exponents have been reported
and debated in the literature. In some cases (e.g. Henderson et al.
1999; Mandal & Rastogi 2005; Mandal et al. 2005), the correlation
could even change from a negative one to positive.
The paper of Hirata (1989) was probably the first article demonstrating the derivation of Aki’s relation D = 3b/c. He in the paper
then presented a negative, instead of positive, correlation between
the b-value and fractal dimension of earthquakes in Tohoku region
of Japan. Later, Wang & Lin (1993) also showed a negative correlation between those two exponents in western Taiwan and they
explained a negative correlation for observed seismicity might be
reasonable due to the isolation of asperities or barriers on the fault

planes, which indicates the calculation of those two scaling parameters (Hirata 1989; Wang & Lin 1993) was actually produced from
events associated with various fault planes/systems.
Yet another interpretation for the negative correlation was provided in Henderson et al. (1999). They found a negative correlation
between the b-value and the fractal dimension of induced seismicity during the initiation of water injection into a well in the Geysers
