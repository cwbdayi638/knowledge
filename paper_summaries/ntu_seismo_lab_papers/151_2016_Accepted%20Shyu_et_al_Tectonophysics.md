a b s t r a c t
The Longitudinal Valley in eastern Taiwan is generally considered as the suture of the collision between the
Philippine Sea and the Eurasian plates, and has attracted numerous geologic and seismologic studies. In the northernmost part of the valley, however, constraints on how structures develop as the suture turns into the Ryukyu
subduction system offshore are still very limited. Therefore, we analyzed relocated seismicity distributions and
focal mechanisms of earthquake sequences, together with tectonic geomorphic investigations to further understand the seismotectonic characteristics of this area. In our seismologic observations, we found two previously
unidentiﬁed reverse faults in the northernmost part of the Longitudinal Valley suture. One is an E–W striking,
south-dipping reverse fault near the Liwu River fan delta, and the other is a N–S striking, east-dipping reverse
fault near the eastern Central Range front. Both these structures connect with a detachment at ~10 km deep,
and may connect with each other to form a curved structural system. The Meilun fault, a well-known active structure that ruptured in a M7.3 earthquake in October 1951, is not seismically active in the past two decades, and may
just be part of a secondary branch of the major structural system. In the northernmost part of the Longitudinal
Valley suture, we propose that as the Coastal Range bedrocks subduct northward beneath the Eurasian plate
with the Philippine Sea plate, the shallow sediments of the Longitudinal Valley, being a buoyant block, do not
subduct, but overthrust northward and westward instead.

1. Introduction
The island of Taiwan is located at the collisional boundary between
the Philippine Sea and the Eurasian plates (e.g., Teng 1987, 1990;
Shyu et al. 2005a, and references therein; Fig. 1). In eastern Taiwan,
the Longitudinal Valley between the Central Range and the Coastal
Range is generally considered as the suture of the collision (e.g., York
1976; Teng 1990; Lee et al. 1998, 2001; Shyu et al. 2005b, 2008,
2011). The Ryukyu subduction system, on the other hand, extends
southwestward from offshore eastern Taiwan, and intersects with the
northernmost Longitudinal Valley suture. As a result, the area of the
northernmost Longitudinal V
