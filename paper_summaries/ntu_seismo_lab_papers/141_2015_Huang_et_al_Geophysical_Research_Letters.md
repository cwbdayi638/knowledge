Abstract Rapid assessment of damage potential and size of an earthquake at the station is highly
demanded for onsite earthquake early warning. We study the application of τ c*Pd for its estimation on
the earthquake size using 123 events recorded by the borehole stations of KiK-net in Japan. The new
type of earthquake size determined by τ c*Pd is more related to the damage potential. We ﬁnd that τ c*Pd
provides another parameter to measure the size of earthquake and the threshold to warn strong ground
motion.

1. Introduction
Over decades of development, earthquake early warning (EEW) system is proven to be one of the
effective tools for real-time seismic hazard mitigation and has been developed and operated in many
countries, for example, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Taiwan, and the Southern California [Kanamori et al., 1997;
Allen et al., 2009; Lee and Wu, 2009; Zollo et al., 2010; Satriano et al., 2011]. EEW aims to provide timely
alerts before the destructive ground shakings strike protected targets, sensitive facilities, or public
transportations.
The two main types of EEW systems are mostly adopted, regional and onsite warning systems. In regional
warning, the seismic data from seismic sensors or arrays deployed in the source region are used to predict the
strong ground motions at a more distant region. In onsite warning, the initial P wave motion of a single
station or an array is used to predict the peak ground motion of later arriving S and surface waves, which
commonly have higher amplitudes or destructive energy than that of the initial P wave at the same site.
Generally, the regional warning has a higher accuracy than the onsite one because of the use of more stations
and complete source rupturing. On the other hand, the onsite warning has a shorter reporting time than the
regional one.
The average period (τ c) of vertical displacement from the ﬁrst 3 s of the P wave is proven to have an
acceptable correlation with the size of an earthquake [Kanamori, 2005; Wu and Kanamori, 2005a; Wu et al.,
2007; Wu and Kanamori, 2008a, 2008b]. The peak amplitude of displacement (Pd) [Wu et al., 2007; Wu and
