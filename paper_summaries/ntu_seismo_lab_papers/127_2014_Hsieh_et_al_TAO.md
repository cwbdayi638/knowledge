Two major earthquakes of ML greater than 6.0 occurred in Taiwan in the first half of 2013. The vibrant shaking brought
landslides, falling rocks and casualties. This paper presents a seismic network developed by National Taiwan University
(NTU) with 401 Micro-Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) accelerators. The network recorded high quality strong motion
signals from the two events and produced delicate shaking maps within one minute after the earthquake occurrence. The high
shaking regions of the intensity map produced by the NTU system suggest damage and casualty locations. Equipped with
a dense array of MEMS accelerometers, the NTU system is able to accommodate 10% signals loss from part of the seismic
stations and maintain its normal functions for producing shaking maps. The system also has the potential to identify the rupture direction which is one of the key indices used to estimate possible damage. The low cost MEMS accelerator array shows
its potential in real-time earthquake shaking map generation and damage avoidance.

1. INTRODUCTION
Taiwan is located on the convergent zone between the
Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The measured
convergence rate of the two plates is about 80 mm per year
(Yu et al. 1997). Therefore, there are high crustal deformations and frequent earthquake activities around Taiwan. Occasionally, a large earthquake can cause serious damage.
In the first half of 2013 two major earthquakes of ML
greater than 6.0 occurred in Nantou County, Taiwan (Fig. 1).
The vibrant shaking caused landslides and falling rocks, and
resulted in many casualties. By quickly pro
