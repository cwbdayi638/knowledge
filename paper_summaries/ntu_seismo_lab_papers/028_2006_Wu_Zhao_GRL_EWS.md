Magnitude estimation using the first three seconds P-wave amplitude
in earthquake early warning
Yih-Min Wu1 and Li Zhao2
Received 10 May 2006; revised 27 June 2006; accepted 17 July 2006; published 24 August 2006.

[1] Pd is the peak amplitude of displacement in the first
three seconds after the arrival of the P wave. We
investigated the attenuation of Pd with the hypocentral
distance R in southern California as a function of magnitude
M, and obtained the following relationship: log (Pd) =
3.463 + 0.729  M  1.374  log (R) ± 0.305. Given an
earthquake location determined by the P-wave arrival times
at stations close to the epicenter, this relationship can be
used to define a so-called ‘‘Pd magnitude’’ of earthquakes.
Our result shows that for earthquakes in southern California
the Pd magnitudes agree with the catalog magnitudes with a
standard deviation of 0.18 for events less than magnitude
6.5. Therefore, Pd is a robust measurement for estimating
the magnitudes of earthquakes and has practical application
in earthquake early warning systems. Citation: Wu, Y.-M.,

1. Introduction
[2] When large earthquake occurs, earthquake early
warning (EEW) provides alerts to urban areas near the
epicenter of the forthcoming strong ground shaking.
Depending on the specific geometry of the earthquake and
the stations used in EEW, the early warning time window
can be a few seconds to a few tens of seconds. This short
warning can be extremely important since even a few
seconds can be sufficient for pre-programmed systems to
take emergency measures, such as the deceleration of rapid
transit vehicles to prevent possible derailment, protective
measures for sensitive facilities such as nuclear reactors to
avoid damage and leakage, orderly shutoff of gas pipelines
to minimize fire hazards, controlled shutdown of manufacturing operations to reduce potential losses, and the activation of structural control. Structural control, also known as
‘‘seismic response control’’, is the latest structural technology to assure the structural safety of buildings during
extremely large earthquakes by controlling the buildings’
vibration characteristics or providing a control force to
suppress their responses using seismic response control
devices.
[3] There are two different approaches to EEW: Regional
warning and on-site warning. In regional warning, traditional seismological methods are used to determine the
locations and magnitudes of earthquakes and to estimate
