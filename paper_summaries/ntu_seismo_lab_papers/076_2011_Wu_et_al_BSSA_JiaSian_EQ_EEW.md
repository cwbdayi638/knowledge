Abstract

We collected the strong-motion accelerograms from the 2010 Jiasian
earthquake (M 6:4) that struck southern Taiwan recorded by the Taiwan StrongMotion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) stations to perform an off-line test for
our proposed short-distance earthquake early-warning (EEW) approach. The 2010
Jiasian earthquake demonstrates the vital need for the short-distance EEW. The tested
short-distance EEW method is a threshold-based approach relying on the amplitude of
the filtered vertical displacement. Our result shows that the EEW lead times by the
tested method are significantly improved compared to those of the current EEW systems (EEWS) in Taiwan for short-distance warning. For sites located at the epicentral
distances of about 25 km the EEW lead times are of 2 to 4 s, ahead of the arrival of the
strong ground acceleration. We propose that this threshold-based EEW method might
be used for target areas and objects of those in the vicinity of seismogenic zones
around the world where warnings are most needed.

Introduction
The Jiasian earthquake (Mw 6:0 and ML 6:4), which
occurred on 4 March 2010, was the largest inland earthquake
to strike southern Taiwan in the nearly 50 years since
the 1964 Paiho earthquake (ML 6:3). The epicenter of the
2010 Jiasian earthquake is located at latitude 22.97° N
and longitude 120.71° E with a focal depth of about
23 km given by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) (Fig. 1).
The fault mechanisms given by Broadband Array in Taiwan
for Seismology (BATS), CWB, United States Geological
Survey (USGS), and Global Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT)
solutions all suggest a thrust mechanism with the fault plane
most likely striking in the northwest-southeast direction and
dipping about 30°–40° to the northeast direction, interpreted from the aftershock and ground-shaking intensity
distributions (Fig. 1).
According to the damage report of the 2010 Jiasian
earthquake released by the Taiwan National Fire Agency,
there were 96 people injured, but thankfully, no deaths.
However, over hundreds of buildings including school buildings were required to be evaluated immediately for their
structural safety. One train of the Taiwan High Speed Rail
(THSR) went off the rails during the occurrence of the Jiasian
mainshock, although the earthquake monitoring and warning
system of THSR had issued an earthquake alert and the train
had automatically applied an emergency stop. Apparently,
the early-warning lead time (i.e., the time interval between

the warning notification and the arrival of the destructing
waves, usually S waves) for the earthquake early warning
systems (EE
