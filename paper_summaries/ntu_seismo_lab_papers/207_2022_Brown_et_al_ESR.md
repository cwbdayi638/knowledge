A structural model is developed for the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt that shows consistency across
an array of data types and marks an important step forward in the consideration of geological hazards and risks.
Although there is general agreement about the regional scale geology of Taiwan, there are considerable differ­
ences in the structural interpretations of its western fold-and-thrust belt. In this paper, we bring together results
of our previous studies and add new data and data analyses to develop a consistent 3D structural model for the
south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt that can explain key aspects of the seismicity, GPS, and topography
data. We interpret the fold-and-thrust belt to be a west-verging, imbricate thrust system developed above a single
basal thrust that is breached by ENE-striking faults that are inherited from the continental margin. These
breaching faults are associated with ENE-striking transverse zones in the fold-and-thrust belt that are marked by
changes in stratigraphy, structural style, strike and dip of the basal thrust, and uplift of the stratigraphic contacts.
Along the eastern flank of the fold-and-thrust belt, metamorphic basement rocks are involved in the thrusting.
Shortening estimates range from 15 km to >25 km. Much of the seismicity is taking place beneath the basal
thrust, in the basement, along the flanks of basement highs and lows where strike-slip and transpressive fault
types are common. There are systematic changes in GPS displacement vectors and strain rates across the
transverse zones. Topography is higher in areas where basement is involved in the thrusting. The proposed
structural model has depth and along-strike consistency, and can explain aspects of the distribution of seismicity,
faults types, GPS displacement vectors and strain rates, and topography of the study area, and can therefore be
considered a viable model.

1. Introduction
Understanding the structure and evolution of the Taiwan fold-andthrust belt is an important and on-going research objective that has
made it an example for the development of ideas about fault-related
folding (e.g., kin
