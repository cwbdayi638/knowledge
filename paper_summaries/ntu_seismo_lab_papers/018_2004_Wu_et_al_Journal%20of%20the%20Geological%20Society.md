Abstract: The 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake series occurred in Central Taiwan, where ongoing

mountain building is most active. The pre- and post-Chi-Chi seismicity helps to clarify the
internal orogenic activity. The 27 000 earthquakes from the 1993-2002 catalogues have
been relocated with greater precision. By associating the seismicity with focal mechanisms,
many structures inside the orogen have been mapped. Among them are a steeply dipping
thrust fault in the deep crust; a 50-km-long left-lateral strike-slip fault in the south; and
an Eastern Central Range NNE-striking normal fault. While the deep crustal thrust appears
to contribute to the root-building, the southern strike-slip slip fault accommodates the mainshock fault motion, and the Eastern Central Range normal faulting probably occurs mainly
after a major western Taiwan thrust type earthquake. Much of the Backbone Range and the
Eastern Central Range were seismically quiescent before and after the Chi-Chi earthquake.
The contrast in the seismicity of the Central Range and the surrounding regions implies
different material behaviour in these different regimes of the orogen.

Taiwan is an active orogen created from the
convergence between the Eurasian and the
Philippine Sea plate (Fig. 1). The rate of convergence is 70 mm/year, based on NUVEL-1 of
De Mets et al. (1990), and recent estimates from
GPS measurement are about 8 cm/year (Yu et al.
1999). This convergence is nearly totally absorbed in the shortening across the Taiwan, as the
rate decreases from over 50 m m / y e a r on the
east coast to essentially zero in the Coastal
Plain. The total rate of uplift is estimated to be
in excess of 5 m m / y e a r in the last million
years, with a 1 cm/year rock uplift rate in the
last 30 years (Liu, C. C., pers. comm., 2002).
The seismicity in the orogen is coupled with
these high rates of crustal movement. Since seismicity is a response to the tectonic stresses, the
location and the focal mechanisms of earthquakes will provide information concerning the
stresses, as well as giving the kinematics of
faults. In this paper we utilize a relatively new
and effective method to relocate more precisely
the hypocentres of earthquakes (Waldhauser
and Ellsworth 2000). The better-resolved hypocentre distribution forms the basis from which
zones of active deformation can be mapped.
Certainly, the presence of seismicity is an unmistakable sign of brittle deformation, but clearly
defined zones of seismically quiescence in the
orogen, especially in between regions of high

activity, call for understanding of possible rheological behaviour of rocks - brittle or ductile in the orogen, and the thermal conditions there.
