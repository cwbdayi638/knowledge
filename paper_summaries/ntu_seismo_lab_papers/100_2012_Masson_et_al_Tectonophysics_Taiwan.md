Using a Bouguer anomaly map and a dense seismic data set, we have performed two studies in order to improve
our knowledge of the deep structure of Taiwan.
First, we model the Bouguer anomaly along a proﬁle crossing the island using simple forward modelling. The
modelling is 2D, with the hypothesis of cylindrical symmetry.
Second we present a joint analysis of gravity anomaly and seismic arrival time data recorded in Taiwan. An initial velocity model has been obtained by local earthquake tomography (LET) of the seismological data. The LET
velocity model was used to construct an initial 3D gravity model, using a linear velocity–density relationship
(Birch's law). The synthetic Bouguer anomaly calculated for this model has the same shape and wavelength
as the observed anomaly. However some characteristics of the anomaly map are not retrieved. To derive a crustal velocity/density model which accounts for both types of observations, we performed a sequential inversion of
seismological and gravity data. The variance reduction of the arrival time data for the ﬁnal sequential model was
comparable to the variance reduction obtained by simple LET. Moreover, the sequential model explained about
80% of the observed gravity anomaly. New 3D model of Taiwan lithosphere is presented.

1. Introduction
The island of Taiwan is at the junction of the Philippine Sea plate and
the Eurasian plate (Fig. 1) and results from the convergence of the Luzon
volcanic arc on the Philippine Sea plate toward the Chinese continental
margin on the Eurasian plate. In the northeast, the Philippine Sea plate
subducts below the Eurasian plate along the Ryukyu Trench. In the
south, the situation is reversed and the Eurasian plate subducts below
the Philippine Sea plate along the Manila Trench (Angelier, 1986). In
Taiwan, the Longitudinal Valley separating the Eurasian plate to the
west and the Philippine Sea plate to the east underlines the plate boundary. No tectonic style of the collision between the Luzon arc and the
Chinese continental margin is unanimously accepted. Two main hypotheses are generally discussed: thin-skinned tectonics (Dahlen et al., 1984;
Davis et al., 1983; Suppe, 1980) and thick-skinne
