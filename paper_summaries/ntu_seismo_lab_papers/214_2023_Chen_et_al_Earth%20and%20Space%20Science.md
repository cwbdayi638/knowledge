Key Points:

• W
 e found a b-value precursor that
coincides with foreshocks for 2 days
before the 2018 ML 6.3 Hualien
earthquake in the source area
• The b-value precursor correlates with
foreshock distribution in the source
area and is likely uncorrelated to the
high coseismic slip
• There is no significant change in the
b-value before M ≥ 6.0 earthquakes in
Taiwan in a majority of the cases that
we analyzed

Abstract Recent studies in the earthquake magnitude-frequency relation (b-value) found that the b-value
can decrease with time before large earthquakes in the source area. Such a decrease even coincided with a
burst of foreshocks immediately before the earthquakes implying a preslip migrating toward the nucleation
zone. We systematically survey the b-value variations in space and time in the source area of 17 earthquakes
with magnitudes greater than ML 6.0 in Taiwan. We relocated the earthquakes released by the Central Weather
Administration of Taiwan since 2012 as timing can provide a sufficiently low completeness magnitude (MC) of
1.5. We carefully determine the spatiotemporal search criteria on seismicity in the source area of all targeted
earthquakes. We surveyed the temporal b-valu
