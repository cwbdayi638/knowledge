a b s t r a c t
The Taiwan mountain belt is generally thought to develop above a through-going basal thrust conﬁned to within
the sedimentary cover of the Eurasian continental margin. Surface geology, magnetotelluric, earthquake hypocenter, and seismic tomography data suggest, however, that crustal levels below this basal thrust are also currently being involved in the deformation. Here, we combine seismic tomography and earthquake hypocenter
data to investigate the deformation that is taking place at depth beneath south-central Taiwan. In this paper,
we deﬁne the basement as any pre-Eocene rifting rocks, and use a P-wave velocity of 5.2 km/s as a reference
for the interface between these rocks and their sedimentary cover. We found that beneath the Coastal Plain
and the Western Foothills clustering of hypocenters near the basement-cover interface suggests that this interface is acting as a detachment. This detachment is located below the basal thrust proposed from surface geology
for this part of the mountain belt. Inherited basement faults appear to determine the geometry of this detachment, and their inversion in the Alishan area result in the development of a basement uplift and a lateral structure
in the thrust system above them. However, across the Shuilikeng and the Chaochou faults, earthquake hypocenters deﬁne steeply dipping clusters that extend to greater than 20 km depth, above which higher velocity basement rocks are uplifted beneath the Hsuehshan and Central ranges. We interpret these clusters to form a deeply
penetrating, east-dipping ramp that joins westward with the detachment at the basement-cover interface. It is
not possible to deﬁne a basal thrust to the east, beneath the Central Range.

1. Introduction
The Taiwan mountain belt has been forming since the Late Miocene
as a result of the oblique collision between the southeast continental
margin of Eurasia and the Luzon volcanic arc on the Philippine Sea
