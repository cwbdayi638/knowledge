Improving Location of Offshore Earthquakes in
Earthquake Early Warning System

ABSTRACT
We proposed an effective approach to improve the accuracy of
offshore earthquake location in the earthquake early warning
(EEW) system of Taiwan. The EEW system was built upon
Geiger’s method for earthquake location that requires a set of
initial estimates (epicenter, depth, and origin time). Because
the initial epicenter highly depends on the locations of inland
stations, for far offshore events the final solution falls effortlessly into a local minimum which may far away from the actual
position. To solve this problem, an approach for choosing a
better initial epicenter was proposed. We added predefined
initial epicenters on the offshore area and then implemented
several programs running Geiger’s method simultaneously. Each
of the programs adopted a different predefined initial epicenter.
The best earthquake location is given by the most timesaving
run, assuming that the solution is converged most efficiently related to the closest distance between the initial and true epicenters. The modified method has been tested with the online EEW
system from June 2016 to July 2017 for offshore east Taiwan. A
total of 60 earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 3.3 to 6.0
were detected successfully. The results were compared with the
estimations from the original EEW system, showing that our
proposed method for offshore earthquakes is able to reduce
location error by about 4.9 km on average.

INTRODUCTION
Taiwan is located on the collision zone between the Philippine
Sea plate (PSP) and the Eurasia plate (EP) and is one of the
most seismically active regions in the world. In the eastern offshore area of Taiwan, the PSP subducts northward underneath
the EP along the Ryukyu trench, causing numerous large earthquakes with magnitude above 7.0 in the past (Fig. 1). Subduction zone earthquakes in general can cause large ground
shakings to the Taipei metropolitan area and caused severe
damages due to the amplification effect (Huang et al., 2010).
For example, the ground shakings from the 1986 M w 6.8
(M w 7.3) earthquake and the 2002 M w 6.8 (M w 7.7) earthquake caused damage to buildings or caused buildings to collapse. The largest instrumentally recorded earthquake of
M w 8.0 (M w 7.7) in Taiwan may have also caused some damage at that time (moment magnitudes were recalculated by

Theunissen et al., 2010). Moreover, according to the geodetic
data, the plate interface in this area is fully locked and has potential to produce M w 7.5–8.7 tsunami earthquakes (Hsu et al.,
2012). Therefore, it is important to enhance the ability of
earthquake monitoring and to accelerate the speed of earthquake notification for offshore earthquakes of eastern Taiwan
(Kao, 1998; Wu et al., 1999).
