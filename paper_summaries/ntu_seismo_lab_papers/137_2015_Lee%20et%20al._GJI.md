It has been generally accepted that the static stress changes after
major earthquakes influence the spatial and/or temporal distribution of aftershocks and subsequent large events (e.g. King et al.
1994; Harris 1998; Stein 1999; Freed 2005; Steacy et al. 2005,
and references therein). Generally speaking, the subsequent events
occur in regions with an increase in Coulomb stress caused by the
major event, and earthquakes become fewer in regions subject to
a negative Coulomb stress change. Whereas the subsequent earthquake events are commonly similar in mechanism as the major event
since the fundamental tectonic and stress regime does not change by
the Coulomb stress change, in places where pre-existing structures
are present, the stress change may result in the occurrence of events
with different mechanisms.
In areas with rich information of seismic catalogue and abundant
structures such as the island of Taiwan, the patterns of earthquakes
before and after a major event are good for observing the effect of
Coulomb stress changes on pre-existing structures. The 1999 Mw
7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake was the largest onland event ever recorded
in Taiwan’s instrumental history. The earthquake was produced by
rupture along a ∼90-km-long segment of the Chelungpu fault (e.g.

638

Chen et al. 2001, 2002; Shyu et al. 2005a; Fig. 1), and resulted in
significant damages and losses in western central Taiwan. Based
on the observation that the overall earthquake patterns of the area
changed after the Chi-Chi event, it has been shown that the stress
field has changed (e.g. Ma et al. 2005). However, the influences of
pre-existing structures on the stress field have not been analysed
in detail. In this paper, we present an analysis of an earthquake
sequence occurred after the Chi-Chi earthquake in the footwall
block of the Chelungpu fault, where subsurface pre-existing faults
are present, and have influenced the mechanisms of the subsequent
earthquake sequence.
