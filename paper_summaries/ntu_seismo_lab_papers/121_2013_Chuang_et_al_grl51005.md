[1] Taiwan’s active mountain belt is a spotlight for orogenic
studies and was ﬁrst used to test the critical-taper wedge
mechanics. The concept of an orogenic wedge above a
shallow detachment surface has been highly inﬂuential on
current understanding of orogenic processes in Taiwan.
However, the recent ML 6.2 and ML 6.5 2013 Nantou
reverse-faulting earthquakes in central Taiwan have
nucleated below the proposed detachment, indicating that
active mountain building is occurring below the orogenic
wedge. We estimate the coseismic slip distributions and fault
geometry using the uniform stress drop slip inversions. The
earthquakes occur on essentially the same 30° dipping fault
plane ramping up from ~20 km depth near a cluster of 1999
Chi-Chi earthquake aftershocks to the shallow detachment
and the Chi-Chi fault plane. The fault could be a deep
extension of a mature shallow fault or a newly developed
deep ramp fault that is not reﬂected in the surface geology.

1. Introduction
[2] Critical-taper wedge mechanics was ﬁrst tested and
illustrated with data from the Taiwan mountain belt (Figure 1)
[e.g., Suppe, 1981; Davis et al., 1983; Dahlen et al., 1984;
Barr and Dahlen, 1989; Barr et al., 1991; Suppe, 2007].
Indeed, wedge mechanics has been highly inﬂuential on current
understanding of the mountain-building process in Taiwan
[e.g., Wang, 2001; Willett and Brandon, 2002; Simoes
et al., 2007; Upton et al., 2009], and numerous studies
construct structural cross sections of Taiwan either explicitly
or implicitly, assuming critical wedge and thin-skinned tectonics mechanisms [e.g., Wang et al., 2000; Loevenbruck
et al., 2001; Mouthereau et al., 2001; Hsu et al., 2003;
Yue et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007; Yanites et al., 2010;
Ching et al., 2011a]. However, while the surface geologic
