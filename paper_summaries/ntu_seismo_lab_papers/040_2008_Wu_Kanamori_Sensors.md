Abstract: As urbanization progresses worldwide, earthquakes pose serious threat to lives
and properties for urban areas near major active faults on land or subduction zones
offshore. Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) can be a useful tool for reducing earthquake
hazards, if the spatial relation between cities and earthquake sources is favorable for such
warning and their citizens are properly trained to respond to earthquake warning messages.
An EEW system forewarns an urban area of forthcoming strong shaking, normally with a
few sec to a few tens of sec of warning time, i.e., before the arrival of the destructive Swave part of the strong ground motion. Even a few second of advanced warning time will
be useful for pre-programmed emergency measures for various critical facilities, such as
rapid-transit vehicles and high-speed trains to avoid potential derailment; it will be also
useful for orderly shutoff of gas pipelines to minimize fire hazards, controlled shutdown of
high-technological manufacturing operations to reduce potential losses, and safe-guarding
of computer facilities to avoid loss of vital databases. We explored a practical approach to
EEW with the use of a ground-motion period parameter τc and a high-pass filtered vertical
displacement amplitude parameter Pd from the initial 3 sec of the P waveforms. At a given
site, an earthquake magnitude could be determined from τc and the peak ground-motion
velocity (PGV) could be estimated from Pd. In this method, incoming strong motion
