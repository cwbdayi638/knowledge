Seismic Quiescence before the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, Mw 7.6 Earthquake
by Yih-Min Wu and Ling-Yun Chiao

Abstract The Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake of 20 September 1999 was preceded
by a notable decrease of the regional seismicity rate. The anomalous period started
in January 1999 and lasted about 9 months, up to the occurrence of the mainshock,
as revealed from analyzing the Taiwan catalog data from 1 January 1994 to 20
September 1999. Our results indicate that the mean seismicity rate is 435 events per
month with a standard deviation of 78 events for earthquakes with magnitude above
2.0. During the anomalous period, seismicity rates fell outside the range of one
standard deviation with a mean value of 314 events per month. There was also a
consistent trend of decreasing regional b-value as well as notable increases of seismic
activity in areas surrounding the Chi-Chi earthquake source region via the Z-test map
(ZMAP) analysis.
Introduction
Seismic precursors are an important but controversial
topic. Among most of the reported precursors, seismic quiescence, which is defined as a significant decrease of the
mean seismicity compared to the preceding background rate,
is one that has received considerable attentions (Mogi, 1979;
Wyss and Habermann, 1988; Wiemer and Wyss, 1994;
Huang et al., 2001; Huang and Nagao, 2002; Huang, 2004).
We wish to examine whether there had been significant seismic quiescence as an observable precursor prior to the catastrophic Chi-Chi earthquake.
Taiwan is located on the western Circum-Pacific seismic belt. In the vicinity of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea plate
subducts northward under the Eurasia plate along the Ryukyu trench to the northeast of Taiwan, whereas the Eurasia
plate subducts eastward under the Philippine Sea plate off
the southern tip of Taiwan. Tectonically, most of the Taiwan
region is under northwest–southeast compression with a
measured convergence rate of about 8 cm/year. Many disastrous earthquakes have occurred in the past, and those that
have occurred from 1900 to 1999 are usually well documented (Fig. 1). These documented earthquakes may be
grouped into two general categories: the earthquakes associated with the subduction of the Philippine Sea plate northward under the Eurasia plate (e.g., near and offshore of Hualien), and the ones associated with active faults in western
Taiwan.
The 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake (Fig. 2) is the
largest event on the Taiwan island in the last century (Shin
et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2000). It caused 2456 casualties,
11,306 injuries, and about $4 billion in property damage.
There was not any early warning reported before the occurrence of the Chi-Chi earthquake. However, a detailed postexamination of the seismicity reveals an interesting anomaly
that occurred about 9 months prior to the mainshock, that is,

the seismic activity had been significantly su
