Conventional inversion schemes for earthquake finite source processes often require the calculation of Green’s functions between
the sources and seismic stations, which can be computationally demanding, and a priori knowledge of the fault-plane parameters (e.g.
Mori & Hartzell 1990; Kuge 2003; Aoi et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2008).
In contrast, the back projection method (BPM) provides a computationally less expensive means to image the kinematic source rupture
processes, and it only relies on the observed waveforms and the
estimated traveltimes between the sources and receivers. In recent
years, this technique has been applied to relatively large earthquakes
(Mw > 7.5) to trace the source ruptures with dimensions of hundreds
of kilometres using teleseismic P waveforms from seismic arrays
(e.g. Ishii et al. 2005; Krüger & Ohrnberger 2005; Walker et al.
2005; Xu et al. 2009; Zhang & Ge 2010; Huang et al. 2011a; Ishii
2011; Kiser & Ishii 2011; Meng et al. 2011, 2012). Furthermore,
Kao & Shan (2004, 2007) back-projects the amplitudes of P-wave

envelopes using local seismic records to determine the orientations of the fault planes, while Pulido et al. (2008), and Allmann
& Shearer (2007) and Honda & Aoi (2009) utilize the near-field
P waves and S waves to map the rupture processes of moderate and
shallow-focus earthquakes, respectively. Although there are various
implementations of the BPM, the underlying concepts and assumptions are similar. Most of the aforementioned BPM implementations
seek to determine only the relative slip intensities or grid brightnesses rather than absolute slip amplitudes on the fault plane due
to normalization of records by the maximum amplitude so that geometrical spreading and other factors affecting amplitudes can be
neglected. In this study, we develop a new and quantitative approach
to the cross-correlation-based back-projection method with template waveform in which the absolute slip amplitude distribution
in the source region is obtained after accounting for geometrical
spreading, material properties in the source region and the nonuniform station distribution correction using local P wave absolute
displacement amplitudes, without compromising the computational
