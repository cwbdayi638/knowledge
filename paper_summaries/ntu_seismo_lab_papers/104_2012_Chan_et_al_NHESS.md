Abstract. In this work, two approaches were employed for
estimating the spatiotemporal distribution of seismicity density in Taiwan. With the use of the rate-and-state friction
model, a model for short-term forecasting according to the
fault-interaction-based rate disturbance due to seismicity was
considered. Another long-term forecasting model that involves a smoothing Kernel function is proposed. The application of the models to Taiwan led to good agreement
between the model forecast and actual observations. Using
an integration of the two approaches, the application was
found to be capable of providing a seismicity forecast with a
higher accuracy and reliability. To check the stability related
to the regression the bandwidth function, the forecasted seismicity rates corresponding to the upper and lower bounds
of the 95 % confidence intervals are compared. The result
shows that deviations within the bandwidth functions had
an insignificant impact on forecasting reliability. Besides, insignificant differences in the forecasted rate change were obtained when Aσ was assumed to be between 0.1 and 0.4 bars
for the application of the rate-and-state friction model. By
considering the maximum Coulomb stress change among the
seismogenic depth, the model presents a better forecasting
ability than that using any single fixed target depth. The proposed methodology, with verified applicability for seismicity
forecasts, could be useful for seismic hazard analyses.

Introduction

In the past few decades, studies and interests in earthquake
forecasting have increased. Among these studies, the rateand-state friction model was proposed by Dieterich (1994).

Based on this model, seismicity rate change is attributed to
a change in the Coulomb stress caused by large earthquakes.
Catalli et al. (2008) applied this model to the 1997 UmbriaMarche sequence, Italy, and found that it was able to illustrate the main features of the temporal evolution of seismicity. However, Chan et al. (2010) examined this model by applying it to the entire Italian region and concluded a marginal
forecasting ability. Therefore, it is not clear if the results can
be attributed to uncertainties from dispensable assumptions
of the Coulomb stress calculation (Catalli and Chan
