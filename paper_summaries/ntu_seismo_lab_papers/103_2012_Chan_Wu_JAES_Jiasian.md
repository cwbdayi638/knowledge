Following the 4 March 2010 MW 6.4 Jiashian earthquake the seismicity rate in southern Taiwan was determined to be signiﬁcantly higher than before the quake and aroused seismic hazard awareness. In this
work, seismic hazards were investigated in terms of earthquake activity, the Coulomb stress change,
the rate-and-state friction model, and short-term seismic hazard assessments. The signiﬁcantly higher
seismicity rate that followed the 2010 Jiashian earthquake was found to mainly be attributed to aftershock
decay, in terms of the modiﬁed Omori formula. The results suggest that aftershock duration may continue
until the end of 2012. The spatial migration of seismicity was modeled using the Coulomb stress changes
of large earthquakes. Most of the consequent events were distributed in the vicinity of large earthquakes.
The observations corresponded to a remarkable stress increase within the same area. Additionally, large
events were located within regions with stress increases promoted by previous earthquakes. The results
conﬁrm interactive relationships between large events. By considering time-dependency, the seismicity
rate evolution was estimated using the rate-and-state friction model. The results indicated that a high
seismic rate will persist at least until the end of 2012. Short-term probabilistic seismic hazard assessments
were also applied in terms of the probability of strong ground motion. Using this application, a sudden
jump in seismic hazards in southern Taiwan was accompanied by each large earthquake. At the end of
2012 it is expected that hazards will return to a background level. Our results may be valuable in the future
to decision-makers and public ofﬁcials engaged in seismic hazard mitigation.

1. Introduction
Human life and property are threatened by devastating earthquakes. For this reason, seismic hazard mitigation is an important issue for scientists and engineers. Using traditional probabilistic
seismic hazard assessments (PSHAs) (McGuire, 1976; Cornell,
1968; and references therein), seismic hazards have been determined to be totally contributed by characteristic earthquakes that
are independent of one another. However, for the case of the 2010
