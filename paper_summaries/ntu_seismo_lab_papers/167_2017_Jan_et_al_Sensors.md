Abstract: Following the recent establishment of a high-density seismic network equipped with
low-cost micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) P-wave-alert-device (P-Alert) by the earthquake
early warning (EEW) research group at the National Taiwan University, a large quantity of
strong-motion records from moderate-magnitude earthquakes (ML > 6) around Taiwan has been
accumulated. Using a data preprocessing scheme to recover the dynamic average embedded within
the P-Alert data, we adopted an automatic baseline correction approach for the P-Alert accelerograms
to determine the coseismic deformation (Cd). Comparisons between the Cd values determined using
global positioning system (GPS) data, strong-motion records from the P-Alert network, and data from
the Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) demonstrates that the near-real-time
determination of Cd values (>2 cm), which provide crucial information for seismic hazard mitigation,
is possible using records from low-cost MEMS accelerometers.
Keywords: low-cost MEMS accelerometers; earthquake permanent displacement; seismic hazard
mitigation; P-Alert

1. Introduction
Over the past few decades, numerous studies on the determination of coseismic deformation
(Cd) using strong-motion data have been published (e.g., [1–6]). In Taiwan, the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) implemented the Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) to provide
high-quality accelerograms for moderate-to-large sized earthquakes. More than 680 free-field seismic
stations are spread out over inland Taiwan, but only approximately 109 stations provide real-time
data transmission. This station coverage is insufficient for the rapid and accurate reporting of both
earthquake parameters (e.g., location and magnitude) and near-real-time shaking maps. To improve
this lack of real-time streaming data, an additional dense seismic network is needed. During recent
years, the earthquake early warning (EEW) research group at the National Taiwan University deployed
a dense seismic network based on micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) [7] accelerometers
(dubbed P-wave-alert-device (P-Alert) [8]). Figure
