Aftershocks of the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, Earthquake: The First Hour
by Chien-Hsin Chang, Yih-Min Wu, Li Zhao, and Francis T. Wu

Abstract Within the hour immediately after the 1999 Chi-Chi mainshock, only
40 aftershocks were located by the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network
(CWBSN) because of the power outage in more than half of the island and the limited
dynamic range of the CWBSN high-gain instruments. Here, by analyzing 20 nearfield, on-scale records from the Taiwan Strong-Motion Instrumentation Program
(TSMIP), we determined a catalog of 296 aftershocks with ML ⱖ3.4 within the first
hour after the Chi-Chi mainshock. Focal mechanisms were also determined for 24
of these aftershocks. The frequency-magnitude relation obtained from the 296 aftershocks indicates that the catalog is complete above magnitude ML 4.3. Most of the
aftershocks occurred in a small-slip region of the mainshock immediately to the north
of the mainshock epicenter. Spatially, the aftershocks appear to migrate downward
from the mainshock hypocenter. Later in the hour, the aftershocks began to concentrate in the fringe area of the main rupture. During the first hour, the b-value as
defined by events in the 4.3 ⬍ ML ⬍ 6 magnitude range is about 1, the value of the
background seismicity, and the frequency of larger events is higher.
Introduction
The Chi-Chi earthquake (Mw 7.6 and ML 7.3) struck
central Taiwan at 17:47 UTC, 20 September 1999 (1:47 a.m.
local time on 21 September). As shown in the map in Figure 1, the surface break runs along the Chelungpu fault, a
roughly 100-km-long north–south trending thrust fault dipping gently to the east with a maximum displacement more
than 8 m (Chen et al., 2001). The hypocenter was located at
23.853⬚ N, 120.816⬚ E with a depth of 8 km. The focal
mechanisms determined by several groups consistently
showed a thrust movement with strike, dip, and rake of about
5⬚, 34⬚, and 65⬚, respectively (Chang et al., 2000).
Seismic networks in Taiwan, including the Central
Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN), the Broadband
Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS), and the Taiwan
Strong-Motion Instrumentation Program network (TSMIP),
have provided excellent spatial coverage in the Chi-Chi
source region. The TSMIP records have already been used
to study the slip history of the mainshock (e.g., Ma et al.,
2001; Ji et al., 2003), and data from the other networks, the
CWBSN in particular, were used to determine the spatial distribution and focal mechanisms of aftershocks (e.g., Kao and
Chen 2000; Chen et al. 2002; Wu et al., 2004). As is common with high-gain seismic networks, CWBSN records were
clipped for most of the events immediately after the mainshock because of the limited dynamic range of the instruments. In addition, a large-scale electric power failure shut
down most seismic stations in northern Taiwan (Wu et al.,
2000
