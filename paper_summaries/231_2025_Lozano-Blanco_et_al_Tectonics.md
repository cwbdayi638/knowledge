Key Points:

• We present a new, orogen‐scale model
of Taiwan's contemporaneous stress
field based on over 7,000 earthquake
focal mechanisms
• Using a novel approach, we show that
Taiwan is undergoing orogen‐parallel
extension driven by lateral extrusion
and free‐boundary collapse
• Stress tensor inversion of earthquake
focal mechanisms provides a robust
tool to resolve depth‐dependent stress
regimes in active orogens

Abstract Syn‐to late‐orogenic extension caused by gravitational collapse is a process that has been
documented in most orogens. In this paper, we investigate the contemporaneous stress field in Taiwan to
examine syn‐orogenic extensional faulting and the possible gravitational collapse modes by which it is taking
place. We use a new, large, well‐constrained, clustered earthquake focal mechanism data set from which we
calculate the stress field (σ1, σ2, σ3), the direction of the maximum compressive horizontal stress (SH), and
determine the most likely fault plane orientations and kinematics. Our results show that, in the upper 21 km of
the crust, shearing, with lesser compression are the dominant stress regimes in the Western Foothills and
Hsuehshan Range, resulting in a complex interaction of strike‐slip (with transpression and transtension) and
thrust faulting. Extension is predominately localized in the upper 14 km of the crust in the Central Range (CR),
where it is roughly orogen‐parallel. SH and the best‐fit fault planes in the CR strike roughly NW‐SE, at a high
angle to the structural and topographic grain. At depths greater than 21 km, compression and shear, with
transpression and min
