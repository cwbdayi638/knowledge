Abstract
On 4 March 2010, an inland Mw 6.3 earthquake occurred near the town of Jiasian in Kaohsiung County, Taiwan causing
large ground shaking and extensive damage. In this study, we integrate the records from the Central Weather Bureau Seismic
Network (CWBSN) and Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) to obtain the relocated earthquake sequence and its first-motion focal mechanisms. This dataset offers us precise and reliable results which suggest a focal depth of
23 km and a possible fault plane of strike 313°, dip 41°, and rake 42° for the Jiasian earthquake. This fault plane significantly
differs from the N-S striking Chaochou Fault (CCF) as well as the principal trend of Taiwan orogenic belt, and should be an
undiscovered fault in southern Taiwan. The relocated Jiasian earthquake sequence initiating from the 23-km-deep mainshock
and terminating at around 10 km in depth also indicates it is a blind fault. Peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground
velocity (PGV) recorded by the TSMIP stations reveal a distinct NW-SE-shape pattern from the epicenter area toward the
Chiayi region, likely due to the directivity and site effects. Such phenomena should be considered for future regional hazard
assessments.

1. Introduction
On 4 March 2010, an inland shallow earthquake (ML
= 6.4 and Mw = 6.3) near the town of Jiasian in Kaohsiung
County, Taiwan, was reported by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) rapid reporting system (Wu et al. 1997, 2002)
and named the “2010 Jiasian earthquake” (Fig. 1). It produced widespread strong ground shaking in southern Taiwan. The maximum PGA up to 475 gal was recorded by
station MTN154 of TSMIP with the epicentral distance of
about 8 km, and most regions with epicentral distances less
than 50 km recorded PGA greater than 250 gal (CWB Intensity scale V, Wu et al. 2003a; Fig. 2a). Hence, this event produced extensive damage such as the collapse of one bridge,
fires at five factories and schools, interruption of the regional power grid (which affected 540000 households), damage
