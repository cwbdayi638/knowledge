Rapid Assessment of Damage Potential of Earthquakes in Taiwan
from the Beginning of P Waves
by Yih-Min Wu and Hiroo Kanamori

Abstract To rapidly assess the potential for damage of an earthquake for purposes
of earthquake early warning in Taiwan, we used the peak displacement and velocity
amplitudes of the first 3 sec of the P wave. The vertical-component records, highpass filtered at 0.075 Hz, are used. We found that the peak initial-displacement
amplitude (Pd) correlates well with the peak ground-motion displacement (PGD) and
the peak ground-motion velocity (PGV) at the same site. When Pd ⬎ 0.5 cm, the
event is most likely damaging. If Pd is combined with the period parameter sc,
determined in an earlier study, then sc ⳯ Pd provides an even more robust parameter
for assessing the potential for damage.
Introduction
For timely seismic emergency response, rapid and accurate determination of the potential for damage of an earthquake is an important issue, especially in the operation of a
seismic early-warning system (Nakamura, 1988; Kanamori
et al., 1997; Teng et al., 1997; Wu and Teng, 2002; Allen
and Kanamori, 2003; Wu and Kanamori, 2005). The potential for damage depends on many parameters, such as the
earthquake magnitude, location, intensity, proximity to population in the area, frequency content of ground motions in
relation to important structures, and others. With a small area
and a population of 23 million, Taiwan ranks among the top
in population density in the world. Any on-land large and
shallow earthquake is likely to be a damaging earthquake.
A similar situation applies equally to many earthquake-prone
and populous areas in the world.
Many researchers investigated the relationships between
seismic losses and the peak ground motion amplitude, such
as peak ground-motion acceleration (PGA) and peak groundmotion velocity (PGV) (Tsai et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2002,
2003, 2004). However, for seismic early-warning purposes,
we need to identify the areas that are most likely to sustain
damage as early as possible before the peak motion occurs.
An earthquake excites both P and S waves. The S wave
carries the major destructive energy, and the smalleramplitude P wave precedes the S wave by the time equal to
the 70% of the P-wave travel time to the station. The initial
portion of the P wave, despite its small and nondestructive
amplitude, carries the information of the earthquake size,
and a good determination of the earthquake size from the P
wave provides information about the strength of shaking being brought by the following S wave. In this study we investigate the possibility of estimating PGA and PGV at a site

from the very beginning of the record at the same site as a
follow-up of our previous work (Wu and Kanamori, 2005).
