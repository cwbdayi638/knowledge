We present an updated evaluation of SE Asian geodynamics that includes the interactions of the South China Sea
(SCS) marginal basin with surrounding plates since the end of SCS spreading 20.5–18 Ma. Newly available Ar39/
Ar40 ages of SCS oceanic crust drilled at IODP U1431 near the SCS East basin extinct spreading center are older
than 18 Ma. Conversely, the oldest ages of the Luzon arc and forearc at Taiwan’s Lanyu island, Coastal range and
Lichi mélange are 17–18 Ma, suggesting that onset of the Manila subduction zone may have begun a few m.y.
earlier. Before ~20.5 Ma, the northern part of the Manila transcurrent fault (MTF), considered as the western
boundary of the Ryukyu subduction zone, was a left-lateral lithospheric-scale shear zone. From ~20.5–18 Ma to
~7 Ma, this portion of MTF was connected to the Manila trench. Since ~7 Ma, the MTF extended into the Taiwan
Longitudinal valley and continued southwards to north Luzon island as near-vertical, left-lateral shear zone.
Today, south of ~24◦ N, the MTF protrudes down to 30 km depths and terminates above the deeper Manila slab.
Since ~7 Ma, the whole MTF shifted 400 km westward with respect to Eurasia and rotated ~23◦ clockwise to
become oriented ~NS north of 16◦ N latitude. We identify a tear fault in the Eurasian (EU) plate north of the
Ryukyu trench that is located south of the Myako and Yonaguni islands. Since ~10 Ma, the tear continuously
progressed westward within EU crust, with the Philippine Sea plate progressively subducting northwestward
between the two lips of the
