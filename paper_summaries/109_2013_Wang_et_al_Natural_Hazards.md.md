Abstract: Earthquake prediction is by all means controversial and challenging, given the
fact that some recent catastrophic earthquakes went unpredicted. Not surprisingly,

statistical approaches have been utilized to model the earthquake randomness in time or
space. One of the suggestions is that the earthquake’s temporal probability distribution
should follow the Poisson model, which is suitable for rare events by definition. As a
result, the customarily-used hypothesis should be at large associated with our prior
judgment that earthquakes are rare, but not a result of abundant quantitative evidence or
theoretical derivation. Therefore, this study aims to offer new empirical evidence to the
hypothesis based on the 110-year-long earthquake data around Taiwan. From the series
of statistical tests, the first statistical inference is indeed in line with the model’s
proposition: the level of fitting between observation and theory is better for earthquakes
