SUMMARY
A moderate earthquake of M w = 6.8 occurred on 2003 December 10. It ruptured the Chihshang
Fault in eastern Taiwan which is the most active segment of the Longitudinal fault as a plate
suture fault between the Luzon arc of the Philippine Sea plate and the Eurasian plate. The
largest coseismic displacements were 13 cm (horizontal) and 26 cm (vertical). We analyse
40 strong motion and 91 GPS data to model the fault geometry and coseismic dislocations.
The most realistic shape of the Chihshang fault surface is listric in type. The dipping angle of
the seismic zone is steep (about 60◦ –70◦ ) at depths shallower than 10 km and then gradually
decreases to 40◦ –50◦ at depths of 20–30 km. Thus the polygonal elements in Poly3D are well
suited for modelling complex surfaces with curving boundaries. Using the strong motion data,
the displacement reaches 1.2 m dip-slip on the Chihshang Fault and decreases to 0.1 m near
surface. The slip averages 0.34 m, releasing a scalar moment of 1.6E26 dyne-cm. For GPS data,
our model reveals that the maximal dislocation is 1.8 m dip-slip. The dislocations decrease to
0.1 m near the surface. The average slip is 0.48 m, giving a scalar moment of 2.2E26 dynecm. Regarding post-seismic deformation, a displacements of 0.5 m were observed near the
Chihshang Fault, indicating the strain had not been totally released, as a probable result of
near-surface locking of the fault zone.
Key words: Chengkung earthquake, Chihshang fault, coseimic deformation, Taiwan.

I N T RO D U C T I O N
The Chengkung earthquake of magnitude M w = 6.8 occurred on
2003 December 10 close to the eastern coast of Taiwan (Fig. 1). The
main shock was felt throughout the Taiwan Island. This event did
not cause human loss, but significant cracks developed at the ground
surface and damaged some buildings. The main surface rupture was
located along the western side of the Coastal Range (Lee et al. 2006).
The hypocentre was first located at 23.106◦ N–121.324◦ E at 16 km
depth near the town of Chengkung (Kuochen et al. 2004). Based on
waveform inversion of broad-band seismograms, it was then relocated at 25 km depth by the Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS) (Official BATS website). The loc
