[1] In this study, a large collection of 41,141 S-P times from the untapped records of

the Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) network is combined with
the P and S wave arrival times from the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau Seismic
Network (CWBSN) to image the Vp and Vp/Vs structures beneath Taiwan. The records
from the 680 TSMIP stations throughout Taiwan in the past 15 years enhance the
path coverage and the resolution in the tomography inversions tremendously. Our result for
the Vp structure largely confirms previous studies but brings better constraint on the Vp/Vs
structure. The colliding Luzon volcanic arc is characterized by a belt of high Vp and
high Vp/Vs with high seismicity that includes the offshore islands of Lutao and Lanyu and
the Coastal Ranges in eastern Taiwan, at the depth between about 13 and 25 km. This
high Vp/Vs belt can be traced to the subduction zone in the region between Hualian and
Ilan in the deeper portion. The shallow portions of the southwestern coastal plain and
the Pingtung region are also characterized by a belt of high Vp/Vs with lower seismicity.
Most of the events occurred at the base of the high Vp/Vs zones. We suggest that
material strength in those regions may be too low to accumulate stress, which may indicate
water-saturated young sediments. Finally, the Central Range region is characterized by
a low Vp/Vs belt.

1. Introduction
[2] Taiwan is situated in the western portion of the Pacific
Rim seismic belt. In the east, the Philippine Sea plate
subducts northward under the Eurasian plate along the
Ryukyu trench. Off the southern tip of Taiwan, the South
China Sea subplate, part of the Eurasian plate, subducts
eastward under the Philippine Sea plate. Figure 1 is a
schematic diagram showing the major geologic settings in
the region. Most of Taiwan is under a northwest-southeast
(NW-SE) compression with a convergence rate of about
8 cm/yr [Yu et al., 1997]. The Taiwan orogeny, started
around 4 Ma [Suppe, 1984], is relatively young on the
geological timescale. The island has a high rate of crustal
deformation and a strong seismic activity, and many disastrous earthquakes have occurred in the past. These damaging earthquakes can be divided into two general classes:
