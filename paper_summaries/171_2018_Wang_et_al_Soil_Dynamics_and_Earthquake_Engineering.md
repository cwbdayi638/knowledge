Recent studies have shown that structural damage exhibits stronger correlations with cumulative absolute velocity (CAV) than other ground motion intensity measures (e.g., PGA). This paper presents a CAV site-eﬀect
assessment for the Taipei areas for the ﬁrst time. The study was based on more than 1200 strong-motion data
from 47 major earthquakes that had occurred around Taiwan. The results show that the site eﬀects are more
conspicuous in the western Taipei than the eastern areas, and it is also obvious that the site eﬀect is strong in
locations close to the rims of the basin, where seismic waves could be easily reﬂected, refracted and superimposed. Subsequently, a map showing the areas in Taipei subject to severe CAV ampliﬁcation and/or high
variability was developed for site-eﬀect microzonation for the study area, on the basis of CAV that was considered better correlated with structural damage under earthquake condition.

1. Introduction
In an attempt to avoid unnecessary post-earthquake shutdowns of
nuclear power plants for safety inspection, in the 1980s the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI) proposed a new ground motion intensity measure called cumulative absolute velocity (CAV). It considers
a motion's amplitude, duration and waveform altogether. Fig. 1(a) illustrates the CAV of a hypothetical ground motion, which is calculated
as follows [1]:

CAV =

∫0

tmax

a (t ) dt

(1)

where a (t ) is the absolute value of acceleration at time t, while tmax
denotes the total duration of the acceleration time history.
The EPRI study also highlighted that among diﬀerent intensity
measures, CAV correlates most strongly with MMI VII (Modiﬁed
Mercalli intensity scale VII) that describes the onset of structural damage. EPRI further suggested 0.3 g-s as the CAV threshold that could
cause damage on the structures with good design and construction [1].
Subsequently, considering small-amplitude motions are unlikely to
cause structural damage, several variants (denoted as CAV’) were proposed by containing only larger-amplitude motions (e.g., [2–5]):
N

CAV ′ = ∑ H (pgai − pgathreshold )

where N is the total duration of a ground motion in seconds, pgai is the
maximum acceleration (absolute value
