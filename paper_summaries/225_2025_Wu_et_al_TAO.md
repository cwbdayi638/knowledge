shakemaps system and onsite warning during
the 2025 ML6.4 Dapu earthquake

Abstract
On January 20, 2025, the ML6.4 Dapu earthquake struck southwestern Taiwan, causing intense shaking in Chiayi
County and Tainan City. The P-Alert real-time shakemaps system generated detailed shakemaps just 36 s after the
earthquake occurred. The areas of strongest shaking were primarily located to the southwest of the epicenter,
which corresponds with the observed damage distribution. Based on the epicenter location, the distribution of
shaking, and the distribution of aftershocks, it is likely that the rupture propagated southwestward from its initiation
point. For this event, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) issued the first report 7.9 s after the earthquake
occurred. Considering the average signal transmission delay of approximately 5 s in the Public Warning System
(PWS), most individual P-Alert devices located within 30 km of the epicenter provided onsite warnings earlier than
the CWA’s regional warning. These observations underscore the effectiveness of the P-Alert system in providing
onsite warnings, as well as its significant advantages in disaster response.

1 Introduction
Taiwan has been developing earthquake early warning (EEW) technology for over 30 years (Wu et al. 1998,
1999). Over these decades, EEW systems have become
a cornerstone of the national disaster mitigation strategy, playing a critical role in enhancing public safety and
response. During the recent 2025 Dapu ML 6.4 earthquake, which occurred on January 20 at 16:17 (UTC), the
Central Weather Administration (CWA) issued its first

earthquake report within 7.9 s, providing a preliminary
magnitude estimate of 6.5. This estimate closely aligns
with the officially reported ML 6.4.
Apart from the CWA’s regional EEW system, the
P-Alert EEW system, developed by National Taiwan University (NTU), also plays a crucial role. The P-Alert system instantly transmits peak ground acceleration (PGA)
and peak ground velocity (PGV) data to the National
Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction
(NCDR) for damage assessment (Wu 2015; Wu et al.
2016). The P-Alert system also generates shakemaps for
public reference via social media. Additionally, strongmotion records from
