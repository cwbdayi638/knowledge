Abstract Moment tensor decomposition is a method
for deriving the isotropic (ISO), double-couple (DC),
and compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) components from a seismic moment tensor. Currently,
there are two families of methods, namely, standard
moment tensor decomposition and Euclidean moment
tensor decomposition. Although both methods can usually provide workable solutions, there are some minor
inconsistencies between the two methods: an equality
inconsistency that occurs in standard moment tensor
decomposition and the pure CLVD unity and flip basis
inconsistency encountered in Euclidean moment tensor decomposition. Moreover, there is a sign problem

when disentangling the CLVD component from a DCdominated case. To address these minor inconsistencies,
we propose a new moment tensor decomposition method
inspired by both previous methods. The new method
can not only avoid all these minor inconsistencies but
also withstand deviations in ISO- or CLVD-dominated
cases when using source-type diagrams.

Article highlights
• We examine the inconsistencies among current
moment tensor decomposition methods.
• Based on insights from observations of these
inconsistencies, we propose an overall consistent
moment tensor decomposition method.
• We discuss some interesting features of the proposed
method and how to extend it to additional applications.

1 Introduction
The seismic moment tensor, which describes the basic
characteristics of an earthquake, constitutes one of the
most crucial quantities derived from point-source
approximations. The spectral decomposition theorem guarantees that the moment tensor must contain real eigenvalues. To associate a physical process with an earthquake, the three-eigenvalue tuple
