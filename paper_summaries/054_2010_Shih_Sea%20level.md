Abstract Captured CO2 could be deliberately injected
into the ocean at great depth, where most of it would
remain isolated from the atmosphere for centuries. CO2 can
be transported via pipeline or ship for release in the ocean
or on the sea floor. No matter what for medium depth or
deep sea, it appears that a potential area exists between
122–122.5°E and 21.8–22.3°N for CO2 sequestration. The
east coast of Taiwan can be a candidate for CO2 temporary
storage or transmitted plant. To have whole picture of
assessment of sea level fluctuation, a completed statistical
summary of seasonal sea level at six tidal gauge stations
along the east coast of Taiwan is provided herein. Seasonal
sea level time series is analyzed using spectral analysis in
frequency domain to identify periodic component and
phase propagation, especially for the astronomical-driven
tidal effects. It identifies that the semi-diurnal and diurnal
components in the resultant time series are related to

demonstrates a full analysis of sea level variations, and
results can be useful when construction of testing or
operating facilities on sea surface becomes desirable in the
future.

1 Introduction
In Taiwan, CO2 release is preliminarily projected to be
0.332–0.531 Gt from 2010 to 2030 with an average
amount of 6.473 Gt within this duration. Direct ocean
injection of CO2 is one of several approaches under
consideration to sequester carbon dioxide in order to
stabilize increasing content of atmospheric CO2. A
potential CO2 storage option is to inject the captured CO2
directly into the deep ocean at depths greater than
1,000 m or more, where most of it could be isolated from
the atmosphere for centuries. This can be achieved by
transporting CO2 through pipelines or ships to an ocean
storage site where it is injected into the water column of
the ocean or at the sea floor. The dissolved and dispersed
CO2 would subsequently become a part of the global
carbon cycle. Ocean storage has not yet been deployed or
demonstrated with a pilot scale so far, and is still in the
research stage. However, there have
