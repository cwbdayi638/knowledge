Frontiers in Earth Science

Large urban areas are marked by their dense population, developed infrastructure, and
vital lifelines, including transportation networks, water, and power. The possibility of
signiﬁcant damage and loss in the event of an earthquake underscores the importance of
assessing seismic hazards in metropolitan areas. The assessment process involves evaluating
potential ground motions, geotechnical site conditions, and the susceptibility of the built
environment to damage. However, in recent years, the assessment of seismic hazard in
metropolitan areas worldwide has become more challenging due to the signiﬁcant expansion
of large-scale infrastructure development. With the continual growth and increasing
population, it is not possible to carry out the contemporary surveys and investigations
required for accurate hazard assessment, especially on a larger scale in old walled cities. This
calls for the development and application of alternate approaches to undertake such studies.
For this, satellite based techniques like interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) are
an alternative for mapping deformations. Also, microtremor investigations are becoming a
useful tool for mapping shear-wave velocities in old and congested settlements where ﬁnding
open space is an Research Topic.
