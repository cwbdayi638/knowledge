[1] A Mw 6.1 earthquake occurred on April 1st, 2006 near
Taitung, eastern Taiwan. It produced significant coseismic
ground displacements and a large number of aftershocks
in the ensuing month. This event provides an opportunity
to diagnose the seismogenic structure in the southern
Longitudinal Valley (LV) of eastern Taiwan, long viewed
as one of the collision sutures between the Philippine Sea
and the Eurasian plates. With precisely relocated main- and
aftershock hypocenters, focal mechanisms for M  3.8
events, and coseismic ground displacements from strong
motion records, we determine a main shock dislocation
model. Our results indicate that the main shock occurred on a
high angle fault (azimuth 198°, dip 77°). The model
comprises a fault with two segments; the main shock and a
large number of aftershocks are associated with the northern
segment that exhibited predominantly left-lateral strike-slip
motion, in agreement with P-wave first motions and
waveform (USGS) solutions. The southern segment
exhibits a slightly larger thrust component, in agreement
with CMT solutions. Tectonically, this event highlights a
NNE-trending fault on the west side of the LV, which is
predominantly strike-slip. The aftershocks clustered to the
east of the main shock, which exhibit mainly thrust
mechanisms, indicate that shortening is still acting on the
sedimentary materials deposited between the Coastal and
Central ranges prior to collision. As a result, the southern
LV is undergoing slip partitioning along different faults,
which has never been specified before. Citation: Wu, Y.-M.,

1. Introduction
[2] Taiwan is located along the plate boundary between
the Philippine Sea plate and Eurasian plate, where two arctrench systems have been interacting since the Miocene.
Arc-continent collision initiated about 5 – 6 million years
ago [Ho, 1986; Teng, 1990] due to the flipped subduction
polarities from southern system into northern system
