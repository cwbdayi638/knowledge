Abstract
Landslides are an example of severe natural disasters that occur worldwide and generate many harmful effects
that can affect the stability and development of society. A better-quality susceptibility mapping technique
for the landslide risk is crucial for mitigating landslides. However, the use of assemblages of multivariate statistical
methods is still uncommon in Indonesia, particularly in the Kepahiang Regency of Bengkulu Province. Therefore,
the objective of this study was to provide an improved framework for creating landslide susceptibility map (LSM)
using multivariate statistical methods, i.e., the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method, the simple additive weight‑
ing (SAW) method and the frequency ratio (FR) method. In this study, we established a landslide inventory consider‑
ing 15 causative factors using the area under the curve (AUC) validation method and another evaluation technique.
The performance of each causative factor was evaluated using multicollinearity and Pearson correlation analysis
with regression-based ranking. The LSM results showed that the most susceptible areas were located in the districts
of Kabawetan, Kepahiang, and Tebat Karai. The high landslide risk in these areas could be attributed to the slope
conditions in mountainous regions, which are characterized by high annual rainfall and seismic activity. The AUC
training values of the AHP, SAW, and FR methods were 0.866, 0.838, and 0.812, respectively. Then, on the validation
dataset, the AHP method yielded the highest AUC value (0.863), followed by the SAW (0.833) and FR (0.807) methods.
Moreover, the AHP method provided a higher accuracy value, which suggests that the AHP method is more suitable
than the other methods. Therefore, our research indicated that all algorithm methods generate a positive impact
and greatly improve landslide susceptibility evaluation, especially for the preparation of landslide damage assess‑
ments in this study area. Finally, the method proposed in this study could improve the feasibility of LSM and provide
support for Indonesian government decision-makers in arranging hazard mitigation measures in the Kepahiang
Regency, Indonesia.
Key points
• In this paper, we present a framework for assembling multivariate statistical methods and developing landslide
susceptibility mapping of Kepahiang, Bengkulu Province, Indonesia.
• The analytical hierarchy process provides the highest landslide susceptibility mapping accuracy and the lowest
uncertainties in the study region.
