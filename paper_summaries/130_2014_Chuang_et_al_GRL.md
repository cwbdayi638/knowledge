Key Points:
• The 2013 Rueisuei earthquake illuminates enigmatic Central Range fault
• Finite-fault slip inversion shows the
fault is west dipping and reverse
• The fault may bound a doubly vergent
Taiwan orogenic wedge

Abstract Rapid exhumation of 3–10 mm/yr of the Taiwan metamorphic range is often explained as
the unrooﬁng of the retrowedge of a doubly vergent mountain belt. Yet, to date, the Central Range fault
forming the boundary of the retrowedge has displayed no deﬁnitive evidence for recent seismic activity and
no unambiguous geomorphic expression over much of the fault. The 2013 M6.4 Rueisuei reverse-faulting
earthquake nucleated at the eastern boundary of the retrowedge and appears to illuminate the west dipping
Central Range fault. We estimate the fault geometry and coseismic slip distribution using a uniform stress
drop slip inversion and surface displacements derived from GPS and strong-motion data. We identify a ~42°
dipping blind reverse fault, consistent with the previously proposed buried Central Range fault beneath the
highly active Longitudinal Valley fault. This earthquake may be the ﬁrst indication that rapid exhumation and
uplift occur along a distinct fault structure bounding the eastern margin of the Taiwan retrowedge.

The Taiwan mountain belt, which is deforming by collision between the Luzon arc and Chinese continental
margin, (Figure 1) [e.g., Suppe, 1981; Byrne et al., 2011] has been analyzed with the theory of critical taper
wedge mechanics [Suppe, 1981; Davis et al., 1983; Dahlen et al., 1984; Barr and Dahlen, 1989; Barr et al., 1991;
Suppe, 2007] and interpreted as an orogenic wedge developing above a detachment at or above the top of
the east dipping Eurasian slab [Suppe, 1981; Davis et al., 1983; Carena et al., 2002; Yue et al., 2005]. However,
since critical taper mechanics views the orogen as a singly vergent wedg
