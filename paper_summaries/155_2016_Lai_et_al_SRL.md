2012 Seismicity Quiescence in Taiwan a Result
of Site-Effect Artifacts
by Tz-Shin Lai, Himanshu Mittal, and Yih-Min Wu
ABSTRACT
A significant seismic quiescence in Taiwan was reported by Wu
and Chiao (2006) before the occurrence of the 1999 M w 7.6
Chi-Chi earthquake. A similar kind of activity was also observed in the 2012 earthquake catalog reported by Central
Weather Bureau (CWB). Seven months in the 2012 catalog
seem to have lower monthly seismicity rates than the one standard deviation below the mean (673  82) for earthquakes
with M L ≥ 2:0. Here, we checked the seismic network in Taiwan and found that some new seismic stations, including the
Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS), were incorporated within the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau Seismic
Network (CWBSN) since 2012. Most of these BATS stations
are located on hard-rock sites, which may affect magnitude estimation because of their site characteristics. To account for
the impact of site effect, earthquake catalog data during the
period of 1994 to 2014 was collected and station correction
was calculated for each station. A strong correlation is found
between station corrections determined in this study and geological settings of the region. Stations located on soil sites have
high amplifications with negative station corrections. On the
other hand, stations located on hard-rock sites have low amplifications with positive station corrections. After applying
station correction, the mean seismicity rate is found to be
716 events per month with a standard deviation of 76 events
for earthquakes with M L ≥ 2:0. We conclude that the reason
behind the apparent low seismicity in 2012 is due to the installation of new seismic stations on rock sites, which lead to
underestimation of M L .

INTRODUCTION
Being located on the western Circum-Pacific seismic belt, Taiwan is perhaps one of the most seismically active regions in
world due to collision of Eurasian plate (EP) and Philippine
Sea plate (PSP) (He and Tsukuda, 2003; Legendre et al., 2015).
Toward east, PSP subducts northward beneath the EP, and toward south the EP subducts eastward under PSP. The suture

zone between PSP and EP divides Taiwan into two tectonic
regions. Because of this geological setting, most of this part of
Taiwan has southeast–northwest compression with a convergence rate of about 8 cm=yr (Yu et al., 1999; Legendre, Chen,
and Zhao, 2014; Legendre, Deschamps, et al., 2014). The collisions between PSP and EP leads to numerous earthquakes of
magnitude 4 and above every year inland and off the east coast
of the Taiwan island (Fig. 1).
A number of techniques are used to evaluate seismic activity of a particular region and seismic quiescence is one of
them. Seismic quiescence is defined as the decrease in earthquake activity in a seismically active region during a certain
period, as compared to ongoing activity in that region.
