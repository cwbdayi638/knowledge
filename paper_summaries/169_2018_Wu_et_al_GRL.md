Key Points:
• The negative linear relationship
between earthquake b-values and
crustal stresses is veriﬁed in a young
orogenic belt for the ﬁrst time
• A high correlation between the
b-value and stress is derived from
a complete earthquake catalog
regionally
• b-values could serve as stress
indicators in a young orogenic belt

Abstract It has been reported that earthquake b-values decrease linearly with the differential stresses in
the continental crust and subduction zones. Here we report a regression-derived relation between
earthquake b-values and crustal stresses using the Anderson fault parameter (Aϕ) in a young orogenic belt of
Taiwan. This regression relation is well established by using a large and complete earthquake catalog for
Taiwan. The data set consists of b-values and Aϕ values derived from relocated earthquakes and focal
mechanisms, respectively. Our results show that b-values decrease linearly with the Aϕ values at crustal
depths with a high correlation coefﬁcient of 0.9. Thus, b-values could be used as stress indicators for
orogenic belts. However, the state of stress is relatively well correlated with the surface geological setting
with respect to earthquake b-values in Taiwan. Temporal variations in the b-value could constitute one of the
main reasons for the spatial heterogeneity of b-values. We therefore suggest that b-values could be highly
sensitive to temporal stress variations.
1. Introduction
The earthquake size distribution in the Earth’s crust commonly follows the Gutenberg-Richter power law
(Gutenberg & Richter, 1944): log10N = a bM, where a is the total number of earthquakes, b is the relative
earthquake size distribution, and N is the number of earthquakes with a magn
