Bayesian Estimation of the Spatially Varying Completeness
Magnitude of Earthquake Catalogs
by A. Mignan, M. J. Werner,* S. Wiemer, C.-C. Chen, and Y.-M. Wu

Abstract

Assessing the completeness magnitude Mc of earthquake catalogs is an
essential prerequisite for any seismicity analysis. We employ a simple model to compute Mc in space based on the proximity to seismic stations in a network. We show that a
b
relationship of the form Mpred
c d  ad  c, with d the distance to the kth nearest
seismic station, fits the observations well, k depending on the minimum number of
stations being required to trigger an event declaration in a catalog. We then propose
a new Mc mapping approach, the Bayesian magnitude of completeness (BMC) method,
based on a two-step procedure: (1) a spatial resolution optimization to minimize spatial
heterogeneities and uncertainties in Mc estimates and (2) a Bayesian approach that
merges prior information about Mc based on the proximity to seismic stations with
locally observed values weighted by their respective uncertainties. Contrary to the current Mc mapping procedures, the radius that defines which earthquakes to include in the
local magnitude distribution is chosen according to an objective criterion, and there are
no gaps in the spatial estimation of Mc . The method solely requires the coordinates
of seismic stations. Here, we investigate the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
seismic network and earthquake catalog over the period 1994–2010.

Introduction
Knowledge of the completeness of earthquake catalogs
is crucial for virtually any seismicity analysis (Habermann,
1987). The completeness magnitude, or Mc, is defined as the
lowest magnitude at which all earthquakes in a space-time
volume are reliably detected (e.g., Rydelek and Sacks, 1989;
Woessner and Wiemer, 2005). Studies such as the analysis of
rate changes, static and dynamic triggering, mapping of seismicity parameters, earthquake forecasting, and probabilistic
seismic hazard assessment commonly require knowledge of
the overall Mc of an earthquake catalog.
If the magnitudes of a set of earthquakes obey the
Gutenberg–Richter law (Gutenberg and Richter, 1944), Mc
can also be defined as the minimum magnitude at which the
(complementary) cumulative frequency magnitude distribution (FMD) departs from the exponential decay (e.g.,
Zuniga and Wyss, 1995). Most existing techniques to estimate Mc follow this second definition, which assumes the
validity of the Gutenberg–Richter law, in other words, the
self-similarity of earthquakes (e.g., Wiemer and Katsumata,
1999; Wiemer and Wyss, 2000; Cao and Gao, 2002; Marsan,
2003; Kagan, 2002, 2003; Woessner and Wiemer, 2005;
Amorèse, 2007; Iwata, 2008). Some notable exceptions are
the techniques by Rydelek and Sacks (1989), who estimate
Mc by comparing the day-to-night ratio of events per mag*Now at Department
