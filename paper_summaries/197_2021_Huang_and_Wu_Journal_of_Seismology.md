Abstract The local magnitude scale ML is defined by
the difference between the observed amplitude (log A)
and the anchored attenuation amplitude (log A0 ). A
previous study in Taiwan established a model of the
anchored amplitude as a function of the hypocentral
distance R by matching the ML to the corresponding
moment magnitude MW . Although the overall performance of the model is adequate, there remain some
drawbacks, namely, the correlated empirical station
correction problem and relatively low sample size. In
this paper, we adopt the concept of the expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm to develop a new
method that can simultaneously estimate the anchored
amplitude model coefficients and station corrections.
The revised catalog using the latest dataset in Taiwan provides an up-to-date accurate estimate of ML .
Additionally, the proposed method can systematically

obtain statistically meaningful results and be applied
to datasets of other regions in the future.

Article highlights: A new method that can simultaneously estimate attenuation function and station corrections is proposed. Based on the new
method, an updated local magnitude has been
established. Using amplitude data in Taiwan, the
updated local magnitude shows better consistency
with the moment magnitude. The station corrections in Taiwan provide an improved assessment of
the geological setting on the island.

The local magnitude ML was proposed by (Richter
1935) as a way to connect the single station seismogram reading to the overall strength of an earthquake.
Due to its straightforward definition, ML has been
widely adopted by many earthquake monitoring agencies. Although ML tends to suffer from saturation
issues due to its frequency dependence measurement,
some studies (Kanamori and Jennings 1978; Bormann
and Giacomo 2010) suggest that ML can better capture the near-field radiation energy of seismic waves
