The southernmost Ryukyu subduction zone may have a geodetically inferred Mw 7.5 to 8.7
megathrust earthquake in a shallow locked region, the Ryukyu fault. Paleoseismological
evidence of historical earthquakes available from the last 417 years indicates that only a
1920 Mw 7.7 earthquake occurred within this magnitude range, near the downdip end of
the Ryukyu fault. As slow slip events downdip the locked seismogenic zone may trigger a
large subduction earthquake, we investigate how the ﬁrst observed slow slip events in
2005, 2009, and 2015 initiated downdip in the Ryukyu fault interface affect the occurrence
of a megathrust. We establish possible megathrust earthquake cycles from Mw 7.5 to 8.7
on the Ryukyu fault using constraints from the magnitude-frequency relation based on
local historical earthquakes. This analysis shows a b value of 1.2 for magnitudes greater
than Mw 7.0, which is higher than the empirical 1.0 value. This indicates that the recurrence
of an event up to Mw 8.7 is longer than previously thought if the megathrust events follow
the observed magnitude-frequency relation. Then, we quantify the inﬂuence of slow slip
events on the triggering of a potential megathrust earthquake by calculating the static
stress increase. We ﬁnd that stress perturbations caused by the three slow slip events are
generally consistent with the values that have triggered the large interplate earthquakes in
several subduction zones. However, a large earthquake has not yet been triggered on the
Ryukyu fault after a sequence of slow slip events. If the 1920 Mw 7.7 earthquake is the last
rupture of the Ryukyu fault, the earthquake cycle on the Ryukyu fault is very likely in an early
stage. However, this is not true if the slow slip events occur toward the end of the
earthquake cycle and there has been no megathrust earthquak
