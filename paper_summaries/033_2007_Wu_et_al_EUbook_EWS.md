Abstract
We report here the recent progress and future development of real-time
seismic monitoring in Taiwan, especially on earthquake early warning system (EWS) developed at the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), using the
telemetered signals from strong-motion instruments. Utilizing a quick
magnitude determination based on the first 10 sec of signals from a virtual
and sub-network which is configured automatically, we were able to reduce the earthquake rapid reporting time to about 30 sec or less. This
represents a significant step towards a more realistic earthquake early
warning capability. This early warning system has been in operation at
CWB since 2002. Comprehensive earthquake reports have been issued
mostly in less than 30 sec, with an average of about 22 sec from the origin
time. At 3 km/sec for a typical crustal shear-wave velocity, the present operation is not useful if an earthquake occurs less than about 70 km from a
city, but the lead time will increase to more than 10 sec for cities at distances greater than 100 km from the earthquake source. In the latter case, a
lead time of several seconds will allow pre-programmed emergency response to take place prior to the arrival of strong ground shaking. In order
to offer earlier warning within an epicentral distance of less than 70 km, a
τc and Pd method was experimented. We used the Taiwan Strong-Motion
Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) accelerograms recorded within epicentral distances of less than 30 km from Mw > 5.0 crustal earthquakes. This
method uses the first 3-sec length records from the onset of P-waves and
could issue an on-site early warning within 10 sec after the event origin
