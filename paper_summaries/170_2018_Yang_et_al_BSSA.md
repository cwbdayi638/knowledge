ShakingAlarm: A Nontraditional Regional Earthquake Early
Warning System Based on Time-Dependent Anisotropic
Peak Ground-Motion Attenuation Relationships
by Benjamin Ming Yang, Ting-Chung Huang,* and Yih-Min Wu*

Abstract The P-alert seismic network, an on-site low-cost earthquake early warning system (EEWS) located in Taiwan, has proven useful in earthquake events since
2010. This dense network can produce detailed shakemaps and identify the direction
of the source rupture in near-real time. Based on real-time acceleration signals and the
proposed time-dependent anisotropic attenuation relationship with peak ground acceleration (PGA), ShakingAlarm, a regional early warning system add-on to the original
P-alert network, can immediately provide (1) an accurate predicted PGA, before the
arrival of the observed PGA, that will give a consistent lead time for hazard assessment and emergency response, (2) a predicted shakemap (PSM) that will converge
faster to the final reported shakemap than the regional EEWS, and (3) a shake contour
area-based magnitude estimation that is robust, even in the absence of a measured
shake contour area such as in the case of an offshore earthquake. Taking the 2016
M w 6.4 Meinong earthquake as an example, the 14th second PSM from ShakingAlarm converges on the final shakemap better than the regional EEWS from the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) in Taiwan. According to our tests, ShakingAlarm
provides a warning using modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) V that is consistent with
the results of another on-site EEWS (Strategies and Tools for Real Time Earthquake
Risk ReducTion [REAKT]). Further performance tests were conducted with another
five M L > 5:5 inland earthquakes from 2013 to 2014. Compared with traditional
regional EEWSs, ShakingAlarm can effectively identify possible damage regions
and provide valuable early warning information (PSM, predicted PGA, and magnitude) for risk mitigation.
Introduction
Located on the western circum-Pacific seismic belt,
Taiwan is frequently struck by earthquakes. The collision
between the nearby Philippine Sea and Eurasian plates contributes to the complex geological features of Taiwan. To the
northeast of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea plate subducts northward under the Eurasian plate along the Ryukyu trench
(Wu et al., 2008). At the southern tip of Taiwan, the Eurasian
plate subducts eastward under the Philippine Sea plate. Tectonically, most of Taiwan is under northwest–southeast
(NW–SE) compression, with a measured convergence rate of
∼8 cm=yr (see Fig. 1). In the past, damaging earthquakes
have caused many casualties. For example, in 1935, a large
earthquake (M 7.1) occurred in the Hsinchu–Taichung area
(3276 deaths, 12,053 injuries, 17,907 houses destroyed, and
37,781 houses damaged), and in 1999, the Chi-Chi earth*Also at Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica 128, S
