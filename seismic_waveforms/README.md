# Seismic Waveforms - NACB Station

This directory contains automatically generated seismic waveform plots from the NACB seismic station.

## Data Source

- **Network**: IRIS FDSN Web Services
- **Station**: NACB
- **Channels**: BH* (Broadband High-gain channels)
  - BHZ: Vertical component
  - BHN: North component
  - BHE: East component
- **Data Duration**: 10 minutes of continuous data
- **Update Frequency**: Every 30 minutes

## Waveform Files

PNG files are named with timestamp format: `waveform_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.png`

Each plot contains three traces showing ground motion in three different directions, which helps seismologists understand:
- Ground shaking patterns
- Seismic wave arrivals (P-waves, S-waves)
- Local and regional seismic activity
- Microseismic background noise

## About the NACB Station

NACB is a seismic station that records ground motion. The data fetched from IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) provides real-time access to seismological data from stations worldwide.

## Automation

This data collection is automated using:
- **Script**: `scripts/fetch_seismic_waveforms.py`
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/seismic-waveforms.yml`
- **Schedule**: Runs every 30 minutes via GitHub Actions

## Notes

When the IRIS FDSN service is temporarily unavailable, the script generates example waveforms from ObsPy sample data to maintain the collection schedule. These plots are clearly marked with "[EXAMPLE DATA]" in the title.
