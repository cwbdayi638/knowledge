ABSTRACT
A dense seismic network can increase Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system capability to estimate earthquake information with higher accuracy. It is also critical for generating fast, robust earthquake alarms before strong-ground shaking
hits the target area. However, building a dense seismic network via traditional seismometers is too expensive and may not be
practical. Using low-cost Micro-Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) accelerometers is a potential solution to quickly deploy
a large number of sensors around the monitored region. An EEW system constructed using a dense seismic network with
543 MEMS sensors in Taiwan is presented. The system also incorporates the official seismic network of Taiwan’s Central
Weather Bureau (CWB). The real-time data streams generated by the two networks are integrated using the Earthworm software. This paper illustrates the methods used by the integrated system for estimating earthquake information and evaluates
the system performance. We applied the Earthworm picker for the seismograms recorded by the MEMS sensors (Chen et al.
2015) following new picking constraints to accurately detect P-wave arrivals and use a new regression equation for estimating
earthquake magnitudes. An off-line test was implemented using 46 earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from ML 4.5 - 6.5 to
calibrate the system. The experimental results show that the integrated system has stable source parameter results and issues
alarms much faster than the current system run by the CWB seismic network (CWBSN).

1. INTRODUCTION
The Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system issues timely warnings before the earthquake produces catastrophic damage in the protected area. There are two types
of EEW systems. The first is an on-site EEW system with
seismometers deployed in the protected area. This kind of
system uses P-wave information, which propagates faster,
to predict the later S waves which have larger amplitudes.
The second type is the regional EEW system in which the
seismometers are deployed in remote sites away from
