Magnitude estimation using the covered areas of strong ground
motion in earthquake early warning
Ting‐Li Lin1 and Yih‐Min Wu1
Received 3 February 2010; revised 12 March 2010; accepted 30 March 2010; published 4 May 2010.

[1] We collected the strong‐motion accelerograms with
peak ground acceleration (PGA) larger than 100 Gal
(1 Gal = 1.0 cm/s2) from large crustal earthquakes in Taiwan
recorded by the Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation
Program (TSMIP) stations to find an empirical relationship
between the area of high PGA and the corresponding
earthquake magnitude. We found that the logarithms of the
areas inside the PGA contours have a linear relation to the
corresponding earthquake magnitudes. We propose that this
relationship might be able to rapidly define the earthquake
magnitude while providing sufficient seismic station
coverage and might have practical application in earthquake
early warning (EEW) and rapid reporting systems. The
proposed magnitude estimation method is directly related to
the level of strong surface shaking and is inherently suitable
for the purpose of the EEW and rapid reporting systems.

1. Introduction
[2] Earthquake early warning aims to provide timely
alerts before the strong ground shakings of a damaging
earthquake to popularized areas, sensitive facilities, or
public transportations. At the very least, EEW system is
expected to immediately provide the rapid reporting of event
location, magnitude, and the intensity map to allow rapid
response after the occurrence of a large earthquake. Although
the EEW time window might seem to be as short as a few
seconds to a few tens of seconds, it can be extremely critical
since even a few seconds are sufficient for pre‐programmed
EEW systems to take emergent safety responses. Therefore,
EEW is a practical, effective approach to reduce seismic risk
on a short time‐scale [Kanamori et al., 1997; Teng et al.,
1997; Wu and Teng, 2002; Allen and Kanamori, 2003;
Kanamori, 2005].
[3] Two types of EEW are mostly adopted at the present
time, regional and onsite warning systems. In regional
warning, the ground shaking characteristics recorded by the
closer‐to‐earthquake seismic sensors or network are used to
predict the strong ground motions at more distant target
areas. In onsite warning, the initial P‐wave motion is used to
predict the ground motions of later arriving S and surface
waves that commonly have higher amplitudes or destructive
