In this work, Båth’s Law, the b-value in Gutenberg–Richter Law (G–R Law) in the form of the 1/b relationship, and both the a- and b-values in the G–R Law were introduced in order to estimate maximum aftershock magnitudes of earthquake sequences in the Taiwan region. The averaged difference of magnitude
between the mainshock and the maximum aftershock is 1.20, and is consistent with Båth’s Law, however,
with a large uncertainty. The large uncertainty implies that the difference may result from a variable controlled by other factors, such as the aftershocks number of an earthquake sequence and magnitude
threshold for mainshock. With 1/b, since 86% of the earthquake sequences with a M P 6.0 mainshock follow this relationship, the upper bound of the maximum magnitude can be estimated for an earthquake
sequence with a large mainshock. The a- and b-values in the G–R Law was also considered by evaluating
maximum aftershock magnitudes. As there are low residuals between the model and the observations,
the results suggest that the G–R Law is a good index for maximum aftershock magnitude determinations.
In order to evaluate the temporal decays of maximum aftershock magnitudes, modiﬁed Omori’s Law was
introduced. Using the approaches mentioned above, the maximum magnitudes and the temporal evolution of an earthquake sequence could be modeled. Among them, the model of the G–R Law has the best ﬁt
with observations for most of earthquake sequences. It shows its feasibility. The results of this work may
beneﬁt seismic hazards mitigation in the form of rapid re-evaluations for short-term seismic hazards
immediately following devastating earthquakes.

1. Introduction
Historical experience has indicated that not only mainshocks,
but also subsequent aftershocks may result in seismic hazards.
For example, the Mw 6.3, 21 February 2011 Christchurch, New
Zealand earthquake is regarded as an aftershock of the Mw 7.1, 4
September 2010 Darﬁeld mainshock (Chan et al., 2012). The Christchurch earthquake caused much more damage and fatalities than
the mainshock. Therefore, understanding the behavior of aftershocks, in terms of maximum magnitude and temporal evolution,
is a crucial issue for seismic hazards mitigation.
Some of previous studies have investigated maximum magnitudes within earthquake sequences. Båth (1965) concluded that
the averaged differ
