Abstract: Seismic instrumentation for earthquake early warnings (EEWs) has improved significantly
in the last few years, considering the station coverage, data quality, and the related applications. The
official EEW system in Taiwan is operated by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) and is responsible
for issuing the regional warning for moderate-to-large earthquakes occurring in and around Taiwan.
The low-cost micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)-based P-Alert EEW system is operational in
Taiwan for on-site warnings and for producing shakemaps. Since 2010, this P-Alert system, installed
by the National Taiwan University (NTU), has shown its importance during various earthquakes that
caused damage in Taiwan. Although the system is capable of acting as a regional as well as an on-site
warning system, it is particularly useful for on-site warning. Using real-time seismic signals, each PAlert system can provide a 2–8 s-long warning time for the locations situated in the blind zone of the
CWB regional warning system. The shakemaps plotted using this instrumentation help to assess the
damage pattern and rupture directivity, a key feature in the risk mitigation process. These shakemaps
are delivered to the intended users, including the disaster mitigation authorities, for possible relief
purposes. Earlier, the network provided only peak ground acceleration (PGA) shakemaps, but has
now been updated to include peak ground velocity (PGV), spectral acceleration (Sa ) at different
periods, and CWB intensity maps. The PGA and PGV shakemaps plotted using this network have
proven helpful in establishing the fact that PGV is a better indicator of damage detection than
PGA. This instrumentation is also useful in structural health-monitoring and estimating co-seismic
deformations. Encouraged by the performance of the P-Alert network, more instruments are installed
in Asia-Pacific countries.
