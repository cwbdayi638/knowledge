Abstract: The earthquake early warning (EEW)-research group at National Taiwan University has
been developing a microelectromechanical system-based accelerometer called “P-Alert”, designed
for issuing EEWs. The main advantage of P-Alert is that it is a relatively economical seismometer.
However, because of the expensive nature of commercial hardware for structural health monitoring
(SHM) systems, the application of SHM to buildings remains limited. To determine the performance
of P-Alert for evaluating post-earthquake building safety, we conducted a series of steel-frame shaking
table tests with incremental damage. We used the fragility curves of different damage levels and the
interstory drift ratios (calculated by the measured acceleration of each story using double integration
and a filter) to gauge the potential damage levels. We concluded that the acceptable detection of
damage for an entire building is possible. With improvements to the synchronization of the P-Alert
sensors, we also anticipate a damage localization feature for the stories of a building.

1. Introduction
During a catastrophic earthquake, hundreds of thousands of buildings could incur damage. When
such a massive quantity of buildings sustain sudden damage, at least several months are required in
order to dispatch engineers on site to assess the remaining seismic capacity, based mainly on subjective
visual examinations, with little support from objective engineering values. Another potential solution
is to install a structural health monitoring (SHM) system with sensors on the building, and record
the necessary seismic response of the building during an earthquake. By doing so, the building can
be seismically evaluated using objective scientific values immediately after an earthquake, without
risking the safety of engineers.
Vibration-based damage detection is a promising area in SHM. The dynamic features in the
modal domain (e.g., natural frequencies [1], mode shapes and their derivatives [2], and flexibility [3]),
in the frequency domain (e.g., frequency response functions [4]), as well as in the time domain
(e.g., the residuals of autoregressive models [5]) are typically selected to assess the integrity of the
structures. Many researchers have reviewed and discussed the global and vibration-based damage
detection methods for str
