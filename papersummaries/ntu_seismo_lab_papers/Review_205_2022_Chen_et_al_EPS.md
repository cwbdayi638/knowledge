Abstract
Geodetic evidence for slow slip recurrence changed by stress perturbations was rare, especially from afterslip fol‑
lowing a nearby large earthquake. The first observed slow slip events in the southernmost Ryukyu subduction
had occurred in 2005, 2009, and 2015 following the nearby 2002 March 31 ­Mw 7.1 Hualien offshore earthquake. To
investigate whether the ­Mw 7.1 earthquake had influenced the occurrence times of the slow slip, we calculated the
coseismic slip distribution and afterslip distribution using the surface displacements from onshore Global Navigation
Satellite System observations. The stress perturbation on the slow-slip regions caused by the coseismic slip was quan‑
tified using the Coulomb failure criteria. We also examined the aftershock distribution and the evolution with time to
clarify the stress perturbations from the afterslip offshore. Our results show that the primary afterslip distribution may
have overlapped the 2009 and 2015 slow-slip patch at the downdip of the earthquake. The coseismic stress pertur‑
bation may have influenced the SSEs area directly by a Coulomb stress increase of probably 0.10 MPa. However, the
2005 SSE patch in the updip depths had only a little coseismic slip and afterslip with the Coulomb stress increase of
approximately 0.06 MPa. We find that most of the aftershocks had occurred in the 2009 and 2015 slow-slip region that
evolved into a typical aftershock sequence at least 2.5 years after the earthquake. The surface geodetic displacements
reveal that the afterslip may have lasted longer than 4.5 years after the earthquake. The evidence for the afterslip
proves that the 2009 and 2015 slow-slip patch was influenced by the afterslip directly for years. We suggest that the
ongoing afterslip may have modulated the coseismic stress perturbation. It may explain the delay of the 2009 slow
slip occurrence compared with the recurrence interval between the 2009 and 2015 slow slip events.
