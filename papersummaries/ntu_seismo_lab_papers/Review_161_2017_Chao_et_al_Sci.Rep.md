Hazards from gravity-driven instabilities on hillslope (termed ‘landquake’ in this study) are an important
problem facing us today. Rapid detection of landquake events is crucial for hazard mitigation and
emergency response. Based on the real-time broadband data in Taiwan, we have developed a near
real-time landquake monitoring system, which is a fully automatic process based on waveform
inversion that yields source information (e.g., location and mechanism) and identifies the landquake
source by examining waveform fitness for different types of source mechanisms. This system has been
successfully tested offline using seismic records during the passage of the 2009 Typhoon Morakot in
Taiwan and has been in online operation during the typhoon season in 2015. In practice, certain levels
of station coverage (station gap < 180°), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR ≥ 5.0), and a threshold of event
size (volume >106 m3 and area > 0.20 km2) are required to ensure good performance (fitness > 0.6 for
successful source identification) of the system, which can be readily implemented in other places in the
world with real-time seismic networks and high landquake activities.
Landquakes such as rockfalls, landslides and rock avalanches are one of the most deadly kinds of natural disasters. In active mountain belts, such gravity-driven events dominate erosion dynamics that are closely linked
to the occurrence of extreme rainfall and/or high seismicity1,2. The catastrophic Shiaolin landquake event in
August 2009, which resulted in 465 deaths, occurred in the mountain area of southern Taiwan during intense and
prolonged rainfall coinciding with the passage of Typhoon Morakot. The bursting of the short-lived (~104 minutes) Shiaolin landquake dam caused further serious flooding damage3. Rapid detection is therefore crucial
for landquake hazard mitigation and emergency response. However, conventional techniques, such as optical
remote sensing, are unable to provide any landquake information during a typhoon period with extreme weather
conditions.
In general, seismic records can be used to investigate a wide variety of sources, such as earthquakes4,5,
icequakes6, nuclear explosions7,8 and mine blasts9,10. Recent studies have demonstrated that seismic monitoring
is also an effective technique to detect landquake events11–16 and capture the ground vibrations induced by river
bedload transport17–19. For real-time monitoring purpose, an automatic scheme for the detection and identification of the landquake sources using seismic signals is needed. However, most landquake detection procedures proposed in previous studies are still not fully automatic. For example, time-frequency analyses of seismic
