a b s t r a c t
As part of a collaborative project involving researchers from the Vietnamese Academy of Science and
Technology (Hanoi, Vietnam), National Taiwan University (Taipei, Taiwan), and Academia Sinica (Taipei,
Taiwan), a 25-station broadband seismic array was installed in northern Vietnam during December of
2005 with the aim of acquiring a wide dynamic range of seismic data at a high spatial density. The stations were designed to image and interpret crustal and mantle structures beneath northern Vietnam,
including information that would help to reconstruct the geodynamic evolution of the Red River Fault
Zone. Since its deployment, the array has recorded signiﬁcant local, regional, and teleseismic events.
The high-quality distance and azimuth coverage of available events will help us to answer questions
regarding the nature of deep seismic structures beneath the array and the regional tectonic evolution.
As an unexpected bonus, the array recorded near-antipodal seismic waves from signiﬁcant seismic events
in South America, thereby providing valuable seismic data for analysis of the Earth’s deep interior. A similar network is planned for South Vietnam in the near future with the aim of studying the deep structure
of the South China Sea. The proposed stations are scheduled for upgrades to enable the real-time transmission of data for earthquake monitoring and tsunami warnings for the South China Sea.

1. Introduction
Insights into the processes of continental collision and resultant
geological effects have been obtained by studying the Himalayan
mountain belt and surrounding regions (Tapponnier et al., 1986;
Molnar et al., 1993). Crustal thickening in and around the Tibetan
Plateau, and associated uplift, are the direct results of collision between the Indian and Asian continents (Fig. 1). Large-scale strikeslip movement along the Red River Fa
