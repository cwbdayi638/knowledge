Precursor of a large earthquake

a b s t r a c t
Variations in the fractal dimension of earthquakes have been suggested to be a precursor of a large earthquake. However, the physical characteristics and seismicity are always different along a large fault system,
and it is difﬁcult to segment a large fault for further investigating. Therefore, the fractal dimension of earthquakes on a given fault only reﬂects the average seismic characteristics of the area and may be unrelated to
precursory activity. In this paper, the evolution of the temporal generalized fractal dimension (Dq) of a seismic
cluster within a small fault system associated with the Chiayi earthquake (ML = 6.4), Taiwan, is investigated.
The earthquakes of this sequence are conﬁned in small source volume and reﬂect the behavior of the local
fault system.
Our results show that the Dq curve of the background stage is smooth with a low multifractal degree (0.36) and
the seismicity is nearly monofractal in the Chiayi region. During the foreshock stage, the seismicity becomes active such that not only the Dq curve exhibits greater variability especially for the steep slope of Dq curve at q = 0
but also the temporal fractal dimension changes from nearly monofractal to multifractal. In the aftershock stage,
the ﬂuctuation of Dq is large and the multifractal degree is up to 1.0. The temporal multifractal property
becomes more pronounced as well. Finally, when the seismicity returns to the background stage, the Dq
curve becomes smooth and nearly monofractal again. Therefore, the ﬂuctuations in the Dq spectrum of an earthquake cluster associated with a large earthquake not only give a clear picture of the temporal alterations in the
seismogenic regimes but also illustrate their variability through time for a large earthquake. In addition, the variation of the slope of Dq curve at q = 0 in the foreshocks may be used as a precursor of a large earthquake.

1. Introduction
Mandelbrot (1967) proposed a new concept of the geometric dimension, the fractal dimension, to estimate the complexity of the
geometry of natural phenomenon. This concept has been used to estimate the fractal dimensions of fault traces
