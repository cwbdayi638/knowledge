Chemical weathering modulates carbon transfer between the crust, hydrosphere, and atmosphere.
The extent to which microbial processes are involved in mineral dissolution remains elusive. Here, we
performed geochemical and molecular analyses of river water and other materials collected from a
rapidly exhuming catchment in eastern Taiwan. In addition to solute generation driven primarily by
pyrite-induced carbonate weathering, highly skewed microbial community compositions with
abundant Sulfuricurvum and Thiobacillus members were detected during high-water periods. The
yields of these taxa were also correlated with those of sulfate and sediments, suggesting that pyrite
oxidation and carbonate dissolution were facilitated by sulfur-respiring microorganisms inhabiting
erodible materials at a pace comparable to the supply of sulfur-bearing minerals through rapid
exhumation. The net CO2 export regulated by such potentially supply-limited, microbially-mediated
mineral weathering greatly surpasses the global average, highlighting active orogens in high-standing
islands as important CO2 contributors rendered by tandem biotic and abiotic processes.
Chemical weathering of silicate minerals has conventionally been treated as
the most effective abiotic sink for atmospheric CO21. While the ﬂuxes of
photosynthesis and respiration are nearly balanced2, the removal of atmospheric CO2 through silicate weathering in line with the burial of biospheric
carbon in major river systems can offset a considerable portion of the CO2
emitted from geological sources (e.g., volcanic and metamorphic degassing),
thereby regulating climatic ﬂuctuations over geological time scales3. However, weathering of geological materials does not necessarily lead to carbon
sequestration but instead contributes to intensifying CO2 emissions (e.g.,
pyrite-induced carbonate dissolution and oxidation of petrogenic organic
carbon)4,5. Growing evidence has shown that pyrite oxidation is much
more prevalent than previously thought5,6. Based on the solute contents
and sulfur isotopic compositions of sulfate, the model calculation
estimates that the export of pyrite-derived sulfate from major rivers could
reach 1.3 × 1012 moles yr−1, a quantity comparable to the solute budget of

silicate weathering7. As sulfuric acid dissolves carbonate minerals more
rapidly than carbonic acid, this reaction leads to a net release of CO2 gas at a
time scale of less than 107 yrs8, thereby counteracting the removal of CO2 by
