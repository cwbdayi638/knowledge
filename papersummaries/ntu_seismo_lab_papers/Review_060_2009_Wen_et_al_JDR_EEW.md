The dense real-time earthquake monitoring network
established in Taiwan is a strong base for the development of the earthquake early warning (EEW) system.
In remarkable progress over the last decades, realtime earthquake warning messages are sent within 20
sec after an event using the regional EEW system with
a virtual subnetwork approach. An onsite EEW approach using the first 3 sec of P waves has been developed and under online experimentation. Integrating regional and onsite systems may enable EEW messages to be issued within 10 sec after an event occurred in the near future. This study mainly discusses
the methodology for determining the magnitude and
ground motion of an event.
Keywords: earthquake, early warning, P wave, ground
motion

1. Introduction
Geologically, Taiwan is located on the western circumPacific seismic belt which is one of the most active seismic regions in the world. In the last century, nearly a
dozen destructive earthquakes have occurred in Taiwan,
including the Meishan earthquake in 1906 (ML = 7.1,
1,258 death), the Hisnchu-Taichung earthquake in 1935
(ML = 7.1, 3,276 death), and the Chi-Chi earthquake in
1999 (ML = 7.3, 2,455 death). Since the occurrence of
earthquakes can not reliably predicted by current technology, progress is being made globally in the research and
development of the earthquake early warning (EEW) system [1–5]. With advances in seismic instrumentation and
communication networks, EEW is becoming a practical
tool for reducing casualties and damage from major earthquakes [6–9]. Two major approaches are being applied in
the EEW development:
1. Regional warning, or front detection, uses real-time
earthquake monitoring networks to determine the
earthquake location, magnitude, and ground-motion

distribution and to send EEW messages to regions
far from the epicenter.
2. Onsite warning uses onsite seismometers to detect
P waves and estimate the earthquake magnitude and
the strong onsite motion [10].
Regional warning provides more reliable EEW messages but requires longer processing time. Onsite warning
complements regional warning to speed up EEW processing and to reduce blind zones where no onsite warnings
are received. Both approaches have progressed markedly
in Taiwan [11], but the EEW system is still undergoing
online testing and has not been applied for disaster reduction practically.
