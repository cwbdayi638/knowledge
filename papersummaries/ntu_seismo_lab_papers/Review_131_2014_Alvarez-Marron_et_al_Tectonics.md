Key Points:
• Mapping in Taiwan gives information
on fault reactivation at shelf-slope break
• Identify an important, northeast striking
lateral structure
• P wave model points to the presence
of a basement culmination

Eurasian continental margin in the north to the thinning crust of its slope in the south. This part of the
foreland thrust and fold belt includes important along-strike changes in structure, stratigraphy, and seismic
velocities. In this paper we present the results of new geological mapping from which we build geological
cross sections both across and along the regional structural trend. Fault contour, stratigraphic cutoff, and
branch line maps provide 3-D consistency between the cross sections. Minimum shortening is estimated to
be ~15 km with displacement overall to the northwest. A P wave velocity model helps constrain the structure at
depth by providing insight into the possible rock units that are present there. P wave velocities of ≥ 5.2 km/s
point toward the presence of basement rocks in the shallow subsurface throughout much of the southeastern
part of the area, forming a basement culmination. The changes in strike of thrusts and fold axial traces, the
changing elevation of thrusts and stratigraphic contacts, and the growing importance of Middle Miocene
sediments that take place from north to south are interpreted to be associated with a roughly northeast striking
lateral structure coincident with the northern ﬂank of this basement culmination. These transverse structures
appear to be associated with the inversion of Eocene- and Miocene-age extensional faults along what was
the shelf-slope transition in the Early Oligocene, uplifting the margin sediments and their higher P wave velocity
basement during Pliocene-Pleistocene thrusting.
