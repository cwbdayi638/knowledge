An Examination of the Threshold-Based
Earthquake Early Warning Approach
Using a Low-Cost Seismic Network
by Chih-Yih Hsieh, Wei-An Chao, and Yih-Min Wu
INTRODUCTION
Earthquake early warning (EEW) systems have been researched
and developed in Japan, Mexico, the United States, Taiwan,
and other countries (e.g., Allen et al., 2009; Satriano et al.,
2011). One important aspect of EEW is to rapidly assess potential earthquake damage using the early portion of ongoing
ground vibration. There are two types of EEW systems, namely,
regional and onsite. Regional EEW systems collect and analyze
seismic data from multiple stations near the epicenter and provide earthquake information (e.g., magnitude and location) to
distant sites. In contrast, onsite systems use the early part of the
P wave to predict impending ground motion for the later S and
surface waves at the same site without necessarily estimating
the source location and magnitude. Thus, onsite systems are
generally faster than regional systems for near-source sites.
Over the past decade, the initial peak ground displacement
(P d ) and predominant period (τc ) for the initial P wave have
been the two most important early warning parameters used to
rapidly estimate the magnitude (e.g., Wu and Kanamori,
2005a; Shieh et al., 2008). Furthermore, several authors (Wu
and Kanamori, 2005b; Hsiao et al., 2009) have found empirical
relations between the Pd and peak ground velocity (PGV) and
peak ground acceleration (PGA). A threshold-based EEW approach was recently tested in several studies. For the threshold-based method, once the initial P-wave amplitude exceeds
a certain threshold, an alarm is issued. Therefore, the EEW
processing time is reduced for a faster warning. Wu and Kanamori (2005b) used 26 earthquake events (M w > 5:0 and focal depth < 35 km) recorded by the Taiwan Strong Motion
Instrumentation Program network. Their results indicated that
P d > 0:5 cm is a good indicator for the earthquake destructiveness. They also suggested the product τc × P d can improve
the reliability of identifying damaging events. Based on the P d
versus PGV and τc versus magnitude empirical relationships,
Zollo et al. (2010) first and Colombelli et al. (2012) later proposed 0.2 cm and 0.6 s as threshold values for P d and τc , respectively, to identify potential damage zones (PDZs) during
the occurrence of an earthquake. However, the EEW system
performance can be influenced by variability in the selected
time window for the initial P-wave data (e.g., Wurman et al.,
2007). This variability may also cause discrepancies when determining a threshold value for threshold-based EEW methods.

In this study, we use acceleration signals from a dense seismic
network based on the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS;
Holland, 2003) accelerometers built by the EEW research group
at National Taiwan University (Wu et al., 2013; Hsieh et al., 2014;
