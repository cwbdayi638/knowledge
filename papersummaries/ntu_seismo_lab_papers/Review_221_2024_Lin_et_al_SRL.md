Abstract
Two subsequent strong earthquakes—the M L 6.6 Guanshan and the M L 6.8 Chihshang
earthquakes—struck southeast Taiwan on 17 and 18 September 2022, causing extensive
damage associated with multiple fault systems. Mapping their coseismic deformation is
crucial for constraining the slip behavior and possible fault interaction. To enhance the
coverage and resolution of the coseismic deformation features for the two events, data
from two dense strong-motion networks are utilized to retrieve coseismic displacements
using a two-stage baseline correction method. The reliability of derived displacements is
validated with cosite Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) data. The denser distribution of the seismic stations supplements the GNSS and seismic data previously reported
and reveals a more detailed view of regional and near-fault deformation. The integrated
results confirm that the surface ruptures caused by the Chihshang earthquake are located
to the east of the responsible Central Range fault, north of the epicenter. The complex
coseismic deformation pattern of the Guanshan earthquake indicates the possible
involvement of local structures especially around Taitung. More critically, localized subsidence created by the southward rupture propagation of the Guanshan earthquake is
depicted between the epicenters of the two earthquakes. This subsidence may impart
large stress on the northern segment of the fault and trigger the Chihshang earthquake.
The enriched near-fault deformation patterns revealed by our newly compiled dataset
offer valuable constraints for understanding shallow slip distribution, shallow versus deep
slip budget, and possible multifault interaction in future investigations.

Introduction
On 17 and 18 September 2022, two subsequent strong earthquakes with local magnitude (M L ) 6.6 and 6.8 struck the
Guanshan and Chihshang townships in southeastern
Taiwan (Fig. 1). The M L 6.8 Chihshang earthquake is the largest inland earthquake in Taiwan after the 1999 M L 7.3 ChiChi
earthquake (Ma et al., 2000; Shin and Teng, 2001), which
caused extensive damages (a victim, two collapsed bridges,
and many damaged buildings) over ∼40 km along the southern
Longitudinal Valley (LV; Ko et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023; Lin
et al., 2023). The focal mechanisms of the two 2022 earthquakes share similar strikes of 201.5° and 210.5°, dips of
61.5° and 56.3°, and rakes of 15.0° and 40.4° from AutoBATS
catalog (Jian et al. 2018). The consistent north-northeast–
south-southwest trend and steep distribution of aftershocks
from the two earthquakes (Sun et al., 2024) suggest a sinistral
high-angle west-dipping fault along the western flank of the
LV (Fig. 1).
