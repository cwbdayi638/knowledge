INTRODUCTION
Because of persistent collisions between the Philippine Sea
plate and the Eurasian plate, Taiwan has been constantly
threatened by large and devastating earthquakes that often
cause large losses of life and property. To reduce losses caused
by future damaging earthquakes, it is crucial for Taiwan to seek
solutions through scientific research. The Earthquake Early
Warning System (EEWS) is one of the most promising tools
for alleviating threats caused by large earthquakes, and has been
tested and operated in many countries (Allen et al., 2009; Lee
and Wu, 2009; Satriano et al., 2011). Taiwan has been developing an EEWS and is one of the leading countries in EEWS
practices (Wu et al., 1998, 1999, 2011; Wu and Teng, 2002;
Hsiao et al., 2009, 2011).
The present EEWS in Taiwan has been operated by the
Central Weather Bureau (CWB) since 1995 and consists of
109 telemetered seismic stations that span the entire region
of Taiwan. The EEWS can provide earthquake information
within 20 s following an earthquake occurrence (Hsiao et al.,
2009, 2011; Wu and Teng, 2002). Although a 20 s reporting
time is short, if the number of seismic stations operating within
the network is increased, this time period can still be reduced.
However, the cost of building such a high-density seismic
network by traditional, force-balance seismometers is extremely
high.
Since the 1990s, the Micro Electro Mechanical Systems
(MEMS) accelerometers introduced in seismic applications
(Holland, 2003) have been cost-saving miniature devices and
ideal for recording strong ground motions. The Earthquake
Early Warning (EEW) research group at National Taiwan University (NTU) worked with a technology corporation to develop a P-wave alert device named Palert (Fig. 1) that uses
MEMS accelerometers for onsite earthquake early warning.
The cost of the Palert device is less than 1=10 the cost of traditional strong-motion instruments and can record real-time,
three-component acceleration signals. The Palert signal resolution is 16 bits with a −2g to 2g range and the sampling rate
is 100 samples per second. Once an earthquake is detected by
the trigger algorithm embedded in a Palert, a corresponding
earthquake watch or warning alarm is sent by the system. The

trigger algorithm includes procedures for the continuous
monitoring of peak ground acceleration (PGA), the short-termaverage (STA)/long-term-average (LTA) ratio (Allen, 1978),
and the peak amplitude of the filtered (a high pass at the
0.075 Hz corner) vertical displacement of the P wave (Pd;
Wu and Kanamori, 2005a, 2008a,b; Wu et al., 2007). Palert
also has networking capabilities that include the streaming
of real-time acceleration signals to the data collection s
