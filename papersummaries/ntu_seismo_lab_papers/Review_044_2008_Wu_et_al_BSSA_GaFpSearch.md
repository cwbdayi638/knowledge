Focal-Mechanism Determination in Taiwan by Genetic Algorithm

Taiwan earthquakes.

Abstract

We determined the focal-mechanism solutions for earthquakes with magnitude ML ≥ 4:0 that occurred in the Taiwan region between 1991 and 2005. Firstmotion polarities of P waves recorded at over 700 seismic stations in Taiwan were
used. Because of the large number of events and stations involved, we implemented
the genetic algorithm in a nonlinear global search for the focal-mechanism solutions.
The algorithm was tuned and validated through synthetic tests. We finally determined
the focal mechanisms of 1635 events with good qualities among 4188 earthquakes.
Focal-mechanism solutions for a majority of the earthquakes display a dominant pattern of thrust-fault type reflecting the compressive stress field due to the plate collision. Normal-fault events occurred at intermediate depths in subduction zones, which
is likely the result of the bending of the subducting slabs. Strike-slip faults are also
found within the Eurasia plate around the Peikang Basement High and in collision
zones near Ilan where the geometry of the colliding plates is complex. Our study provides a database of focal mechanisms for studying seismogenic structures and plate
tectonics. This database can also be used by structural seismologists to compute synthetics for waveform tomography studies.

Introduction
Taiwan is situated in one of the most tectonically and
seismically active regions in the world. It is the place where
two plates, the Eurasian and the Philippine Sea plates, collide
with each other. Along the Ryukyu trench in the east, the
Philippine Sea plate plunges northward under the Eurasian
plate. To the south of the island of Taiwan in the South China
Sea, the Eurasian plate subducts eastward under the Philippine Sea plate. Figure 1 is a schematic diagram showing the
major geologic settings in the region. The Longitudinal
Valley (LV) in southeast Taiwan is the suture zone between
the Eurasian and the Philippine Sea plates. This suture zone
separates Taiwan into two major tectonic provinces. The
eastern side consists of the Coastal Range and several volcanic islands and is the leading edge of the Philippine Sea
plate. The western province is part of the Eurasian continental shelf (Ho, 1999) and can be classified into four northnortheast–south-southwest-trending geological belts. They
are, from west to east, the Coastal Plain, the Western Foothills, the Hsueshan Range, and the Central Range.
As a result of the regional tectonic activities, most parts
of Taiwan have been under a northwest–southeast compression with a convergence rate of about 8 cm=yr (Yu et al.,
1997). The Taiwan orogeny, started around 4 Ma (Suppe,
1984), is relatively you
