Preface to the Focus Section on the 6 February
2018 M w 6.4 Hualien, Taiwan, Earthquake
by Kuo-Fong Ma and Yih-Min Wu
An intense earthquake swarm with several tens of M w 5+ class
events began shaking offshore eastern Taiwan on 4 February
2018. Two days after the swarm began, an M L 6.26 (M w 6.4)
earthquake struck eastern Taiwan on 6 February 2018 at 11:50
p.m. (local time). This earthquake originated offshore approximately 15 km north of the city of Hualien at a depth of about
10 km and ruptured toward the southwest, with a surface
rupture inland within the city of Hualien along the Milun
fault. This surface rupture resulted in severe damage to several
tall buildings and caused 17 deaths, as well as 289 injuries. The
centroid moment tensor (CMT) focal mechanism from the
Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) and the generalized
Cut-and-Paste (gCAP) from the Broadband Array in Taiwan
for Seismology demonstrated that this M w 6.4 event had
mainly a strike-slip focal mechanism with a minor thrust component dipping to the west. It also had a large compensated
linear vector dipole (CLVD) component, consistent with
the U.S. Geological Survey CMT solution and the real-time
moment tensor solution (Lee et al., 2013). The field investigation report of the Central Geological Survey (CGS, 2018)
suggested a possible involvement of two identified surface ruptures, one along the Milun fault and another along the Linding
fault, despite the origination of the mainshock offshore northeast of Hualien. However, the observed surface rupture along
the Milun fault is a strike-slip fault dipping to the east. The
discrepancy between the focal mechanism of the mainshock
and the observed surface rupture inland along the Milun fault
has focused attention on this event and also raised doubt about
the rupture mechanism of the 2018 Hualien earthquake.
Historical events in this region have been studied and
characterized by the features of previous earthquake swarms
(Shyu, Chen, et al., 2016). Significant historical damaging
earthquakes occurred on 22 October 1951, when three
M w 7+ class earthquakes happened within 12 hrs. Several surface rupture patterns of the 6 February 2018 event were found
to be similar to those of the 22 October 1951 events along the
Milun fault. The Taiwan Earthquake Model (TEM) project
published a National Seismic Hazard Map in December
2015 (Wang et al., 2016) and showed that the Hualien region
has about an 80% probability of experiencing an earthquake
with the CWB intensity V (> 80 Gal) or larger in next 50 yrs.
The seismogenic structures (Shyu, Chuang, et al., 2016) that
were adopted for the seismic hazard map revealed a short
recurrence interval of the Milun fault of 70 yrs and thus the
highest seismic potential, with a probability of an M w 6.4
earthquake of about 42% in the next 50 yrs. Unfortunately,

this high-seismic-hazard potential did not receive enough attention at the time, resulting in significant damages and casual
