SUMMARY
We study internal deformation of the Taiwan orogen, a young arc-continental collision belt,
which the spatial heterogeneity remains unclear. We aim to ascertain heterogeneity of the
orogenic crust in depth when specifying general mechanisms of the Taiwan orogeny. To reach
this goal, we used updated data of continuous GPS (cGPS) and earthquake focal mechanisms
to reassess geodetic strain-rate and seismic stress fields of Taiwan, respectively. We updated
the both data sets from 1990 to 2015 to provide large amount of constraints on surficial and
internal deformation of the crust for a better understanding. We estimated strain-rate tensors
by calculating gradient tensors of cGPS station velocities in horizontal 0.1◦ -spacing grids via
Delaunay triangulation. We determined stress tensors within a given horizontal and vertical grid
cell of 0.1◦ and 10 km, respectively, by employing the spatial and temporal stress inversion. To
minimize effects of the 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi–Chi earthquake on trends of the strain and stress, we
modified observational possible bias of the cGPS velocities after the earthquake and removed
the first 15-month focal mechanisms within the fault rupture zone. We also calculated the
Anderson fault parameter (Aφ) based on stress ratios and rake angles to quantitatively describe
tectonic regimes of Taiwan. By examining directions of seismic compressive axes and styles of
faulting, our results indicate that internal deformation of the crust is presently heterogeneous in
the horizontal and vertical spaces. Directions of the compressive axes are fan-shaped oriented
between N10◦ W and N110◦ W in the western and mid-eastern Taiwan at the depths of 0–20 km
and near parallel to orientations of geodetic compressional axes. The orientations agreed with
predominantly reverse faulting in the western Taiwan at the same depth range, implying a brittle
deformation regime against the Peikang Basement High. Orientations of the compressive axes
most rotated counter-clockwise at the depths of 20–40 km, coinciding with transition of styles
of faulting from reverse to strike-slip faulting along the depths as revealed by variation of
the Aφ values. The features indicate that internal deformation o
