Abstract It is evident that the hydrodynamic dispersion
coefficient and linear flow velocity dominate solute transport in aquifers. Both of them play important roles
characterizing contaminant transport. However, by definition, the parameter of contaminant transport cannot be
measured directly. For most problems of contaminant
transport, a conceptual model for solute transport generally
is established to fit the breakthrough curve obtained from
field testing, and then suitable curve matching or the
inverse solution of a theoretical model is used to determine
the parameter. This study presents a one-dimensional solute transport problem for slug injection. Differential
analysis is used to analyze uncertainty propagation, which
is described by the variance and mean. The uncertainties of
linear velocity and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient
are, respectively, characterized by the second-power and
fourth-power of the length scale multiplied by a lumped
relationship of variance and covariance of system parameters, i.e. the Peclet number and arrival time of maximum
concentration. To validate the applicability for evaluating
variance propagation in one-dimensional solute transport,

1 Introduction
Groundwater moves at rates that are both greater and less
than the average linear velocity. On the macroscopic scale,
the domain includes a sufficient volume that the effects of
individual pores are averaged (Bear 1972). As fluid moves
through pores, it moves faster in pore centers than along
the edges. Some of the fluid particles will travel along
longer flow paths in the porous media than other particles
over the same linear distance. Some pores also are larger
than others, which allow the fluid flowing through these
pores to move faster. If all groundwater containing a solute
were to travel at exactly the same rate, it would displace
water that does not contain the solute and create an abrupt
interface between the two fluids. However, because the
solute-containing water entering the system d
