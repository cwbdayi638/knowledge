[1] The structure of the Taiwan mountain belt is thought to be that of an imbricate thrust
and fold belt developed in a forward breaking sequence above a shallowly dipping basal
detachment. In recent years, however, a growing amount of seismicity data from the
internal part of the mountain belt indicates the existence of widespread fault activity in the
middle and lower crust, suggesting that deeper levels of the crust must be involved in the
deformation than predicted by the shallow detachment, imbricate thrust belt model.
To address this issue, we present new geological mapping, together with earthquake focal
mechanism and seismic energy release data from the central part of Taiwan. We concur
with the interpretation that the foreland basin part of the Western Foothills comprises an
imbricate thrust system that is developing as a forward breaking sequence that is
structurally and kinematically linked to a basal detachment at between 7 and 10 km depth.
To the east of the foreland basin, however, in the Hsuehshan and Central Ranges, our data
show the presence of two fault systems. An earlier, inactive thrust system with a
well-developed cleavage is cut by a system of steeply dipping active faults that penetrate to
a depth of 25 to 30 km or more. In the Hsuehshan Range, the second fault system is best
represented by a structural and kinematic model in which this part of the mountain belt
forms a zone of transpression with a structural architecture similar to that of a crustal-scale
positive flower structure. Eastward, in the Central Range, Mesozoic basement rocks are
over thrusting strongly folded and cleaved deep water sediments of the first, now inactive,
thrust system. The involvement of deep crustal levels and Mesozoic basement in the
second fault system is suggestive of the reactivation of preexisting basin-bounding faults
that were located on the Eurasian continental margin.

1. Introduction
[2] The structure of the faulted and folded rocks involved
in the Taiwan mountain belt (Figure 1) is often presented as
an imbricate thrust and fold belt developed in a forward
breaking sequence above a shallow, east dipping basal
detachment [Suppe, 1980, 1981; Ding et al., 2001; Carena
et al., 2002; Yue et al., 2005; Malavieille and Trullenque,
2009]. The bulk of the data for this interpretation of the
structure come from surface geological observations, shallow reflection s
