SUMMARY
We performed inversions of earthquake focal mechanisms in central Taiwan to investigate the
heterogeneity of the stress field and fault strength, and temporal variations of stress parameters,
friction and pore pressure associated with the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. We divided the focal
mechanism data into two groups: before and after the Chi-Chi earthquake, and analysed them
separately. With the assumption of a uniform stress field, the friction coefficient is mostly within
a range of 0.2–0.4 in central Taiwan, which is lower than the commonly quoted laboratory
result, 0.6–0.85. The low friction coefficient is also inferred by the rotation of principal stress
axes after the Chi-Chi earthquake. By contrast, if we assume that the friction is constant
and failures occur on optimally oriented planes, we find that the resulting stress orientations
must be spatially variable. However, a large dispersion of stress orientations is not seen in
borehole breakouts and fault slip data, implying a constant friction model might be ruled out.
Our analysis suggests that either the distribution of the coefficient of friction or pore pressure
changed during the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. We infer that the pore pressure probably rose in
the Chi-Chi rupture area and northern Longitudinal Valley and dropped in the areas south of
the coseismic rupture area after the main shock.
Key words: Permeability and porosity; Friction; Fault zone rheology; Earthquake source
observations.

Measurements of stress orientations and stress magnitudes are key
elements for a better understanding of the tectonic process and earthquake mechanics. Borehole measurements indicate that breakout
azimuths at depth are generally aligned with the regional minimum
horizontal stress (Bell & Gough 1979; Zoback et al. 1985; Brudy
et al. 1997; Wu et al. 2007a), whereas breakout orientations are
heterogeneous on active fault zones. Thus, localised breakout rotations may be indicators of recent active faulting (Barton & Zoback
1994; Wu et al. 2007a). Breakout directions inferred from a 2-kmdeep hole in Taiwan Chelungpu fault drilling project (TCDP) reveal
some minor fluctuations of the orientations of maximum horizontal
principal stress; this suggests small
