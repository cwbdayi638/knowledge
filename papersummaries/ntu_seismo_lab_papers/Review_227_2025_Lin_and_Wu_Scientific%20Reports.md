Magnitude determination in earthquake early warning (EEW) systems remains a significant challenge.
On April 2, 2024, a Mw 7.4 earthquake struck Taiwan. The Central Weather Administration (CWA) EEW
system estimated the magnitude at 6.8 within 15 s, resulting in no alerts for the Taipei metropolitan
region, which experienced an intensity level of 5 lower (PGV ≥ 15 cm/s) on the CWA’s intensity scale.
The lack of warning alerts sparked widespread complaints, highlighting concerns over the effectiveness
of the current EEW system. This study compares the parameter cumulative absolute absement ( CAA
) with the currently used parameters — the peak vertical displacement ( P d) and the average period
( τ c ) — for quick magnitude estimation of the April 2, 2024, earthquake using low-cost sensors.
Results indicate that P d provides closer estimates of the CWA final ML but carries higher uncertainty.
Conversely, CAA yields more stable estimates. Notably, the northward rupture of this earthquake
caused overestimation when only northern stations were used and underestimation with only
southern stations, underscoring the critical importance of proper station distribution. Interestingly,
τ c demonstrates less sensitivity to rupture directionality, suggesting its potential robustness in such
scenarios. These findings underscore optimizing parameter selection and station configuration for
robust EEW, enabling rapid magnitude estimation to significantly reduce losses.

Taiwan situated at the convergent boundary between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate. This
region is characterized by complex tectonic interactions, which make Taiwan highly susceptible to frequent and
destructive earthquakes, often causing significant loss of life and extensive property damage. Over the years,
the region has endured numerous catastrophic seismic events (Fig. 1). For example, on September 20, 1999, the
Chi-Chi MW 7.6 earthquake struck central Taiwan, resulting in 2,456 fatalities, 11,306 injuries, and $4 billion in
property damage 1–3. The 2016 Meinong Mw 6.4 earthquake occurred on February 5 in southwestern Taiwan,
causing 117 fatalities, 504 injuries, 141 houses destroyed, and 162 houses damaged 4. The 2018 Hualien Mw 6.4
earthquake struck eastern Taiwan on February 6, leading to 17 fatalities, 289 injuries, and the destruction of four
buildings 5. Similarly, the 2024 Hualien Mw 7.4 earthquake resulted in 21 fatalities (includes 3 missing), 1,155
injuries, and severe transportation disruptions 6, with most of the damage caused by landslides and falling rocks
7. These events highlight the urgent need for effective mitigation strategies to reduce seismic risks and enhance
resilience.
