Abstract
Between September 17 and 18, 2022, a series of earthquakes struck the southern Longitudinal Valley of Taiwan, causing
severe damage to infrastructure, particularly bridges, railroads, buildings, and highways in Taitung and Hualien. The primary
event in this sequence was the Chihshang earthquake, measuring magnitude of ML 6.9, preceded by a significant foreshock
of ML 6.4 the day before. Notably, the highest intensity reported in the epicentral region during this earthquake sequence
reached 6 + , marking the highest intensity ever recorded since the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) revised its seismic intensity scale. In this study, we examined the strong ground motion data recorded by the low-cost P-alert network to investigate
the cause of structural damage to buildings, railway stations, schools, and other structures in the affected area. Our analysis
encompassed data from a total of 17 monitoring stations. The observed peak ground acceleration (PGA) ranges from 0.06 g
and 0.78 g, the peak spectral acceleration or response spectrum (PSA) spanned from 0.20 g at 0.50 s to 3.87 g at 0.41 s, and
site amplification varied from 4 at 0.6 Hz to 12.6 at 5.2 Hz. The reported damage of single storey house at Taitung City is
correlated with the higher amplification 4.5 at 0.14 s; Bridge and factory at Chihshang Township is correlated with the higher
amplification 5 at 0.17 s; Railway station at Zhuoxi Township with the higher amplification 7.5 at 0.3 s; of three storey building at Yuli Township with amplification 8 at 0.26 s and, also higher PSA 2.83 g at 0.29 s, and several schools at Kaoshiung
City with amplification 7.2 at 0.37 s and with high PSA 3.87 g at 0.41 s. Additionally, we studied the static Coulomb stress
changes resulting from the coseismic slip of the main shock, which contributed to an increase in aftershock occurrences.
The occurrence of a high-intensity earthquake ( ML 6.9) on September 18, 2022, within a region of positive Coulomb stress
changes, provides support for the hypothesis of aftershock triggering. Through analysis, we found that stronger foreshock
( ML 6.4) occurred in the rupture area of mainshock foreshock, positioned adjacent to the main fault.
