A Study on Kappa Value in Taiwan Using
Borehole and Surface Seismic Array
by Tz-Shin Lai,* Himanshu Mittal, Wei-An Chao, and Yih-Min Wu†

Abstract

Since the inception of the borehole seismic array deployed by the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) in Taiwan in recent years, a large quantity of strong-motion
records have been accumulated from frequently occurring earthquakes around Taiwan
that provide the opportunity to investigate the spectral decay parameter kappa (κ) and
to understand further the site effects of seismic stations. In this study, we used 133
earthquakes recorded at 30 borehole seismic arrays. Each array includes two forcebalance accelerometers, one at the surface and the other inside the borehole. Based on
the regression analysis between κ-value and hypocentral distance for each surface–
borehole station pairs, the resulting κ 0 derived from surface stations are higher than
results from borehole stations. The estimated κ 0 -values are found to range from 0.032
to 0.097 s at surface and 0.012 to 0.078 s in borehole. In comparison with a study of
site corrections for earthquake magnitude determination, these higher κ 0 -values associated with negative station corrections can correspond to the effect of soil conditions.
To evaluate station corrections of borehole seismic array, we collected records from
the cosite stations of Taiwan Strong-Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) and
Central Weather Bureau Station Network (CWBSN) and then derived a linear relationship between the κ 0 -values and station corrections. Finally, both resulting station corrections and κ 0 -values reveal high coherence in local site conditions.

Introduction
Ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) are statistical models to predict ground-shaking parameters (peak
ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, spectral acceleration) as a function of source, site, and path-effect parameters
like magnitude, faulting pattern, epicentral distance, and site
conditions. As seismic waves travel from source to recording
stations, their amplitude and frequency gets changed. They get
attenuated or amplified according to propagation path as well
as site conditions. Attenuation in seismological studies can
be described as decay of amplitude with distance. Highfrequency spectral decay consists of all three factors, namely
source, site, and path. In the 1980s, it was observed that attenuation of high-frequency spectra cannot be explained using whole-path attenuation (Ktenidou et al., 2013). The
amplitude of the spectrum increases until it reaches corner
frequency (f0 ). Beyond f0 , the shape of the spectrum is defined in different ways.
Hanks (1982) first proposed the concept of high-end cutoff frequency fmax and stated that the spectrum is flat from
