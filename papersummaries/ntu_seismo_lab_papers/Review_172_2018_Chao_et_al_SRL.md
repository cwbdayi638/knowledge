Was a Tsunami Warning Possible?

ABSTRACT
Tsunamis generated by mass movements such as landslides,
underwater slumps, and rock avalanches can lead to serious
inundation of nearby populated areas. The lack of timely estimations of the moving mass volume, however, makes providing operational early warnings for landslides particularly
challenging. In June 2017, a large landslide in Greenland generated tsunami waves of about 1 m high that impacted the
small town of Nuugaatsiaq. We show how the seismic analysis
of real-time seismic records from the Greenland Ice Sheet
Monitoring Network (GLISN) can provide estimates of essential physical properties of the landslide such as collapse mass
and sliding velocity shortly after origin time. The estimation
of the landslide source parameters can be utilized for tsunamiwave simulations. We demonstrate how the real-time integration of seismic waveform inversion with forward tsunami-wave
simulation could have enabled a timely operational warning
(about 10 min) before the arrival of the impending tsunami
waves at the village of Nuugaatsiaq.

INTRODUCTION
Gravity-induced mass movements such as landslides and rock
avalanches pose a serious threat to human life. Rapidly moving
landslide masses, for instance, can cause both human casualties
and significant damage to infrastructure. Most landslide dams
form when a mass of sediments and rock, eroded from mountain and hill slopes, blocks the river channels. A possible dambreaking flood with high flow velocity also has the potential
to destroy the downstream area (Costa and Schuster, 1988).
Moreover, landslides occurring in coastal regions can generate
potentially destructive tsunami waves when the sliding mass
enters the water, which present serious hazards to coastal
populations. On 17 June 2017, at 21:39 local time, a large landslide (2000 m long and 1100 m wide, Fig. 1a) occurred in
Greenland when a landslide mass descended into the sea at
Karrat Fjord. Differential digital elevation models (DEMs) estimate a landslide volume of 35–51 million cubic meters
(3:5–5:1 × 107 m3 ). The landslide triggered a tsunami that
washed up in a remote region near the village of Nuugaatsiaq,
reportedly killing four people, injuring dozens, and washing
away eleven homes (Bessette-Kirton et al., 2017).

This tsunami-generating landslide in Greenland raised a
pressing question: Can we detect in time the potential tsunami
hazard of landslide events and issue warnings before the arrival
of destructive tsunami waves? Early warning for landslidegenerated tsunami is particularly challenging due to the lack
of information on properties, such as collapsing mass, needed
to run numerical simulations. Fortunately, seismic stations can
detect long-period (LP, 20–150 s) seismic waves generated by
landslide sources due to the un
