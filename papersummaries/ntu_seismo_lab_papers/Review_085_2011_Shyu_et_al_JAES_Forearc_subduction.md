a b s t r a c t
A very common but important observation of collided and accreted volcanic arcs is that the forearc
regions of these arcs are largely or even entirely missing. The processes and mechanisms responsible
for the removal and transport of the forearc materials from the collisional belts are thus important issues
in understanding tectonics and crustal growth. The young and ongoing collision between the Luzon volcanic arc and the Eurasian continental margin that forms the island of Taiwan provides a rare opportunity
to examine these processes and mechanisms as they occur. From observations of a new detailed 3-D
tomography combined with relocated hypocenters of two earthquake sequences occurred in 2003 and
2006, we found that the Luzon forearc lithosphere initially underthrusts westward after the collision
began. As the collision proceeds, the forearc basement then subducts eastward beneath the colliding
and accreting Luzon arc along a major fault system in eastern Taiwan. Thus the Luzon forearc lithosphere
appears to be removed by tectonic erosion and is being transported eastward into the mantle. Our results
from the active Taiwan orogen will provide important insights for interpreting rock records from many
old arc-continent collisional belts in the world.

1. Introduction
When analyzing previously collided and accreted volcanic arc
blocks in collisional belts worldwide, a common observation is that
the forearc regions of those arcs are entirely or largely missing
(e.g., Howell, 1989; Cloos et al., 2005). For example, the collided
and accreted Jurassic Talkeetna–Bonanza arc in southern Alaska
is missing almost all of its forearc materials (e.g., Clift et al.,
2005). Since the forearc regions are usually more than 100 km
wide (for example, the Sumatran forearc is 200–250 km wide,
and the Luzon forearc south of Taiwan before collision is
100 km wide), a signiﬁcant amount of lithospheric materials
has to be removed from the collisional belt. The mechanisms
responsible for the removal of these materials are
