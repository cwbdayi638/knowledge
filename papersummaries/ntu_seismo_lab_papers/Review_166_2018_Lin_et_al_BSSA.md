Abstract

The 5 February 2016, Meinong, Taiwan, earthquake brought extensive
damage to nearby cities with significant pulse-like velocity ground motions. In addition
to the spatial slip distribution determination using filtered strong-motion data, we show
that, with the advantage of the densely distributed seismic network as a seismic array, we
can project the earthquake sources (asperities) directly using nearly unfiltered data,
which is crucial to the understanding of the generation of the pulse-like velocity ground
motions. We recognize that the moderate but damaging M L 6.6 Meinong earthquake was
a composite of an Mw 5.5 foreshock and an M w 6.18 mainshock with a 1.8–5.0 s time
delay. The foreshock occurred at the hypocenter reported by the official agency,
followed by the mainshock with a centroid located at 12.3 km to the north-northwest
of the hypocenter and at a depth of 15 km. This foreshock–mainshock composition
is not distinguishable in the finite-fault inversion because it filtered the seismic data
to low frequencies. Our results show that the pulse-like velocity ground motions are
mainly attributed to the source of mainshock with its directivity and site effects, resulting
in the disastrous damages in the city of Tainan. Although finite-fault inversion using
filtered seismic data for spatial slip distribution on the fault has been a classic procedure
in understanding earthquake rupture processes, using a dense seismic network as a
seismic array for unfiltered records helps us delineate the earthquake sources directly
and provide more delicate information for future understanding of earthquake source
complexity.

Introduction
of peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity
(PGV) with the seriously damaged buildings (squares), which
confirmed that the largest shaking and velocity region was
very close to the city of Tainan. The damages and fatalities
caused by this moderate-size earthquake with moderate focal
depth surprised the community. It requires further attention to
understand future seismic hazards.
Seismologists commonly determine source characteristics
for moderate-to-large earthquakes by the finite-fault inversion
technique. They assume a fault plane based on an obtained
focal mechanism and calculate Green’s functions for geophysical records (e.g., seismic waveforms) on each subfault
within the entire fault plane. Thus, they can solve for the sliptime history at all the subfaults on the fault plane. Because of
the limitation of the velocity structure, only low-frequency
