Abstract: Using low-cost sensors to build a seismic network for earthquake early warning (EEW) and
to generate shakemaps is a cost-effective way in the field of seismology. National Taiwan University
(NTU) network employing 748 P-Alert sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)
technology is operational for almost the last 10 years. This instrumentation is capable of recording
the strong ground motions of up to ± 2g and is dense enough to record the near-field ground
motion. It has proven effective in generating EEW warnings and delivering real-time shakemaps
to the concerned disaster relief agencies to mitigate the earthquake-affected regions. Before 2020,
this instrumentation was used to plot peak ground acceleration (PGA) shakemaps only; however,
recently it has been upgraded to generate the peak ground velocity (PGV), Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) Intensity scale, and spectral acceleration (Sa ) shakemaps at different periods as value-added
products. After upgradation, the performance of the network was observed using the latest recorded
earthquakes in the country. The experimental results in the present work demonstrate that the new
parameters shakemaps added in the current work provide promising outputs, and are comparable
with the shakemaps given by the official agency CWB. These shakemaps are helpful to delineate
the earthquake-hit regions which in turn is required to assist the needy well in time to mitigate the
seismic risk.
