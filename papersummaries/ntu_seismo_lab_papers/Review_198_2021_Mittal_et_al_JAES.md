Two earthquakes having almost the same magnitude occurred in the Hualien area of Taiwan in 2018 and 2019.
The 2018 earthquake had a magnitude ML 6.2 produced severe destruction; however, the 2019 earthquake (ML
= 6.3) did not cause any severe damage. The P-Alert Strong Motion Network provides real-time shakemaps, in
addition, to earthquake early warning (EEW) in terms of lead-time. Each instrument provides a different leadtime using peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV). During both the events, the in­
struments reported a lead-time of 1.5 to 8.0 s in the epicentral region. This network system also generated highquality shakemaps during both earthquakes. The shakemaps showed that the higher PGAs are concentrated in
the epicentral region for the 2018 and 2019 earthquakes. The lower PGA contour (≥25 Gal) extended to a
broader area, including Taipei, during the 2019 earthquake compared to the 2018 earthquake. However, PGV
shakemaps display a different pattern. The higher PGV values (more than 17 cm/s) are observed in the epicentral
region during the 2018 earthquake (locations suffering building collapse) compared to the 2019 earthquake,
suggesting that PGV correlates better with damage distribution as compared to the PGA. The PGV shakemap,
currently only available for the P-Alert network, provides crucial information that complements the PGA issued
by the official agency in Taiwan.

1. Introduction
Being located on the junction of two tectonic plates, Taiwan Island is
one of the seismically active areas in the world. The Philippine Sea plate
(PSP) moves toward the Eurasian plate (EP) at a velocity of approxi­
mately 7 cm/year (Yu et al., 1997). Due to the collision of these two
plates, the accumulated stresses are released, causing earthquakes in
and around Taiwan Island. In addition to this collision, several other
local faults in western and southern Taiwan are also responsible for the
frequent earthquake activity in Taiwan. Taiwan Island has a long history
of earthquakes. The largest recorded earthquake in the last two decades
is the Chi-Chi earthquake
