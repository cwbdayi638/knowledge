SUMMARY
In a tectonically active setting large earthquakes are always threats; however, they may also be
useful in elucidating the subsurface geology. Instrumentally recorded seismicity is, therefore,
widely utilized to extend our knowledge into the deeper crust, especially where basement
is involved. It is because the earthquakes are triggered by underground stress changes that
usually corresponding to the framework of geological structures. Hidden faults, therefore, can
be recognized and their extension as well as orientation can be estimated. Both above are of
relevance for assessment on seismic hazard of a region, since the active faults are supposed
to be re-activated and cause large earthquakes. In this study, we analysed the 1999 October
22 earthquake sequence that occurred in southwestern Taiwan. Two major seismicity clusters
were identified with spatial distribution between depths of 10 and 16 km. One cluster is nearly
vertical and striking 032◦ , corresponding to the strike-slip Meishan fault (MSF) that generated
the 1906 surface rupture. Another cluster strikes 190◦ and dips 64◦ to the west, which is
interpreted as west-vergent reverse fault, in contrast to previous expectation of east vergence.
Our analysis of the focal solutions of all the larger earthquakes in the 1999 sequence with the
3-D distribution of all the earthquakes over the period 1990–2004 allows us reinterpret the
structural framework and suggest previously unreognized seismogenic sources in this area.
We accordingly suggest: (1) multiple detachment faults are present in southwestern Taiwan
coastal plain and (2) additional seismogenic sources consist of tear faults and backthrust faults
in addition to sources associated with west-vergent fold-and-thrust belt.

Modern tectonic environment of Taiwan
It is well known that Taiwan is seismically active since it is located in
a setting of arc-continent collision (Tsai et al. 1977; Wu 1978). This
collision is produced by the interaction of two arc-trench systems
with flipped subduction polarities (inset of Fig. 1; Suppe 1981; Ho
1986; Teng 1990). The southern system (i.e. the Manila trench and
Luzon arc)
