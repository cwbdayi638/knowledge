Building Effects on the P-Alert-Based RealTime Shaking Map Determination
by Kai-Shyr Wang, Wei-An Chao, Himanshu Mittal, and Yih-Min Wu
ABSTRACT
Recently, the P-wave-alert-device (P-alert) network, which is a
dense array of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) accelerometers that was developed and installed by National Taiwan
University for the purposes of earthquake early warnings, has
recorded a large number of strong-motion records for moderate-to-large earthquakes throughout Taiwan. However, many
of these stations are mounted on the vertical walls of buildings
in ways such that further studies of the sensor-structure interactions on recorded acceleration data are required before the
data is used in the production of high-quality shake maps. In
this study, we collect the free-field accelerograms recorded
by the Taiwan Strong-Motion Instrumentation Program
(TSMIP) network that were operated by the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB), where MEMS accelerometers were in the
vicinity. Then, we compare the peak ground acceleration
(PGA) ratio (R-value) between P-alert and TSMIP stations.
Finally, we demonstrate how to use the R-value correction
on the P-alert data, in order to rapidly produce high-resolution
shake maps for relief work to be done soon after major earthquakes. At present, the shake maps produced by the P-alert
network are posted automatically in real time on Facebook and
are provided to the National Science and Technology Center
for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) in order to allow for their
relief work. These timely products provide improved information for disaster risk reduction, emergency preparedness, and
emergency response.

INTRODUCTION
Being located on the junction of two active subduction systems
(namely Ryukyu to the north and Manilla to the south),
Taiwan is a seismically active region. Active orogeny in Taiwan
can be attributed to the collision between the Eurasian plate
(EP) and the Philippine Sea plate (PSP; Lin and Watts, 2002;
Wu et al., 2009). Thousands of M > 2 or 3 magnitude earthquakes occur in Taiwan every year as a result of collisions between the PSP and EP. In the past, many significant and
devastating earthquakes occurred; examples include: the 1999
Chi-Chi M w 7.6 earthquake (Chang et al., 2000, 2007), the
2003 Chengkung M w 6.8 earthquake (Wu et al., 2006), the
2010 Jiasian M w 6.3 earthquake (Huang et al., 2011), and
the February 2016 Meinong M w 6.4 earthquake (Wu et al.,
2016; Kanamori et al., 2017). The most recent significant

earthquake, an earthquake of M w 6.4, occurred on 6 February
2018 in the Hualien area of Taiwan. Because of the high level
of seismicity, it is necessary to produce high-resolution shake
maps in near-real time for the purposes of disaster risk reduction and emergency response. In Taiwa
