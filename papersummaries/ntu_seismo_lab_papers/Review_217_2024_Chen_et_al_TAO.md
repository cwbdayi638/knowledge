Abstract
The doubly vergent orogen in Taiwan is a relatively young and active arc-continent collision caused by the convergence of Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates occurring along a complicated seismogenic plate boundary. This study
aims to investigate the evolutionary and tectonic features of the retro-wedge, a region contributing to the uplifting
and shortening of the Taiwan orogen. Through the utilization of seismic tomographic image and relocated seismicity, we identify three potential seismogenic structures along the convergent plate boundary: the Longitudinal Valley
Fault, the Ludao–Lanyu Fault, and the Central Range Fault. A significant discovery in our investigation is a westdipping backthrust of the Central Range Fault, extending from the north Hualien city to the southeastern offshore
at a distance of 300 km. The fault is responsible for the formation of a crustal-scale pop-up structure, contributing
to the development of a double vergent orogenic wedge in the retro-wedge. The genesis of the basement-involved
backthrust is attributed to the indentation of the exhumed forearc mantle wedge and remnant forearc crust
into the Backbone Range during collision. Consequently, the plate boundary exhibits two opposite vergent thrust
systems of the Longitudinal Valley Fault–Ludao–Lanyu Fault and Central Range Fault, which evolved during different
stages of collision-incipient and mature following the closure of the forearc basin of the North Luzon Trough and Longitudinal Valley, respectively. These findings contribute novel insights into the tectonic framework of the convergent
zone and provide valuable constraints for geodynamic models of arc-continent collision.
