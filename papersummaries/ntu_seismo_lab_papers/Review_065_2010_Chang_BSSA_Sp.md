Short Note
Basement Imaging Using Sp Converted Phases from a Dense
Strong-Motion Array in Lan-Yang Plain, Taiwan
by Chien-Hsin Chang, Ting-Li Lin, Yih-Min Wu, and Wen-Yen Chang

Abstract

We have collected a large number of accelerograms recorded by the
Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) stations to study the thickness variations of Quaternary alluviums beneath Lan-Yang Plain, Taiwan, using an Sp
converted wave. The estimated thicknesses of the Quaternary sediments inferred by
the travel-time difference of S and Sp waves are between 200 and 1400 m and become
thicker toward the northeast. In general, our resulting features of the time difference of
arrivals between Sp and S waves are consistent with the previous studies on thickness
variations of the Quaternary alluviums beneath Lan-Yang Plain assuming the converting point is at the unconsolidated Quaternary alluvial sediments–Miocene basement
interface. Our study suggests that this technique of using P-S converted phases could
be applied to the other populated basins or plains in the Taiwan region based on its
dense coverage of the TSMIP stations and high seismic activity. This technique is
simple and time effective and can be used to determine the general characteristics of
velocity/thickness structure of a study area.

Introduction
It is well known that unconsolidated, alluvial sediments
have a profound effect on the characteristics of ground shaking because of a strong impedance contrast between soft
sediments and the underlying hard basement rock (Aki, 1988;
Darragh and Shakal, 1991; Langston, 2003a). In addition to
high values of site amplification and anelastic attenuation
(Phillips and Aki, 1986; Langston, 2003b) that are commonly
recognized as effects of near-surface soft, low-velocity
sediments, P-S converted phases (i.e., P-to-SV or SV-to-P
conversions) could be efficiently produced at a sediment–
basement boundary of a strong impedance.
P-S converted waves have been used to map interfaces
at a wide range of scale lengths. The discontinuities between
lower crust and upper mantle (e.g., Moho discontinuity) and
subducting lithosphere boundary have been mapped by
P-S conversions (Snoke et al., 1977; Ruppert et al., 1998;
Frederiksen et al., 2003; Serrano et al., 2003; Zeyen et al.,
2005). In the upper crust, the P-S converted phases generated
at the interface between the Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments and the underlying rocks have also been studied to
constrain the sediment–basement boundary (Andrews et al.,
1985; Chen et al., 1996). Hough (1990) provided an encouraging example of using P-S conversions generated
at a very shallow depth to constrain the thicknesses of lowvelocity, Quaternary alluvium and Holocene mud in the San
Francisco Bay area.
