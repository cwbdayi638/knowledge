a b s t r a c t
We explore regional stress states in the vicinity of the rupture area of the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake
by reconciling data from the Taiwan Chelungpu-Fault Drilling Project (TCDP) in-situ measurements and
earthquake focal mechanisms. Given the background deviatoric stress in the range of 10–50 MPa and the
horizontal NW–SE directed maximum principal stress axis, the predicted fault types show strike–slip and
normal faulting near the coseismic surface rupture and thrust and strike–slip faulting in central Taiwan. Such
predictions are able to ﬁt TCDP in-situ observations in a local scale and aftershock earthquake focal
mechanisms in a regional scale. Additionally, the proposed stress state explains remarkable rotations of the
maximum stress axes observed near the northern segment of the Chelungpu Fault. This result provides key
information for forecasting of consequent earthquakes and evaluation of focal mechanisms after the
occurrence of a large earthquake.

1. Introduction
Many devastating earthquakes occurred in central Taiwan in the
past century (Fig. 1), such as the 1935 Hsinchu–Taichung MGR7.1
earthquake (Huang and Yeh, 1992), the 1998 Rueyli Mw5.7 earthquake (Chan and Ma, 2004a; Chen et al., 1999; Wu et al., 2003), the
1999 Chi-Chi Mw7.6 earthquake, which is the largest earthquake ever
recorded inland Taiwan (e.g., Chang et al., 2007; Ji et al., 2001, 2003;
Shin and Teng, 2001; Yu et al., 2001), and the 1999 Chiayi Mw6.2
earthquake (Chan and Ma, 2004a; Chang and Wang, 2006; Chen et al.,
2008). Due to a dense urban population in central Taiwan, it is
necessary to investigate crustal stress regimes in order to build up a
seismic hazard mitigation system. By comprehending crustal stress
orientation and magnitude, one can evaluate possible focal mechanisms of future earthquakes and their respective magnitude or
recurrence time (Linsley et al., 2005). According to background stress
state and stress perturbation imparted by earthquakes, one can
calculate stress evolution and further forecast spatial distribution of
consequent earthquakes (King et al., 1994).
Previous studies have inferred crustal strain or stress states in
Taiwan from different data sets. Seno (1977), Seno et al. (1993), and
Yu et al. (1997) investiga
