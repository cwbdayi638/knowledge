Abstract
The risk of earthquakes and their effects on both nature and infrastructure in seismically
active regions of India require adaptable and scalable earthquake early warning (EEW)
systems. Developing a robust EEW system is crucial to mitigate earthquake risks in the
region, but it is a challenging task. Various institutes have attempted to develop EEW systems using different methods. Still, there is no common consensus, and issues remain with
response time and reliability of disseminated information to the public. Efforts by institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, have advanced EEW technologies, focusing on dense seismic sensor networks, real-time data processing algorithms, and
effective dissemination mechanisms. Recent initiatives aim to improve sensor sensitivity
and accuracy through fast communication systems for quicker earthquake detection. However, challenges persist in making EEW accessible and affordable, particularly in remote
areas, due to the lack of a nationwide system. The National Centre for Seismology (NCS),
under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), is piloting an EEW system in the NW
Himalayas, which could lead to a nationwide implementation. Developing region-specific
algorithms for rapid data analysis and nurturing collaboration between academic institutions, government agencies, and international partners are crucial steps. Public awareness
campaigns and educational programs are essential for community resilience and timely
response to earthquake alerts. Establishing a robust EEW system in India could significantly enhance earthquake risk mitigation efforts in earthquake-prone zones of the country and should be viewed within the context of a holistic risk reduction framework. EEW
systems can enhance mitigation efforts, but they must be complemented by other essential
measures, such as improving building resilience and promoting public awareness.
