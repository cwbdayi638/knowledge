Empirical Relationships between Aftershock Zone Dimensions and
Moment Magnitudes for Plate Boundary Earthquakes in Taiwan
by Wen-Nan Wu, Li Zhao, and Yih-Min Wu

Abstract

In this study, we establish the empirical relationships between the spatial
dimensions of the aftershock zones and moment magnitudes (Mw ) for the Taiwan
region. The length (l) and width (w) of the aftershock zone of an earthquake is measured by the major and minor axes, respectively, of the ellipse of a two-dimensional
Gaussian distribution of one-day aftershocks. Our data is composed of 649 mainshocks (depth ≤ 70 km, M w 4.0–7.6) between 1990 and 2011. The relationships between aftershock zone dimensions and Mw were obtained by least-squares method
with the corresponding uncertainties estimated by bootstrap. Our study confirms that
aftershock zone dimensions are independent of faulting types and the seismic moment
is proportional to l3 . The ratio (w=l) increases slightly with M w and is independent of
faulting types. Together with previous study, our results suggest that earthquakes of
both small (M w  4:0) and large (Mw ≥ 7:0) magnitudes have similar focal zone geometrical parameters. By using the Mw –S relation, where the aftershock zone area S is
estimated from l and w, we also provide an independent examination of the variations
in the median stress drop. We find that the median stress drops of strike-slip earthquakes are higher than those of thrust events. Moreover, the median stress drops are
independent of the moment magnitudes for normal and strike-slip events but decrease
for large thrust events. These results are consistent with the latest global observations.
Regardless of faulting types, the median stress drop decreases for larger (6 ≤ M w ≤ 7:6)
and relatively deep (depth ∼ 60–70 km) earthquakes.

Introduction
Over the past several decades, the empirical relationships between seismic moment (M 0 ) or moment magnitude
(Mw ) and various earthquake faulting parameters (e.g., rupture length, width, and displacement) have been studied by
a number of researchers on the basis of worldwide data
sets (e.g., Scholz, 1982; Bonilla et al., 1984; Scholz et al.,
1986; Romanowicz, 1992; Wells and Coppersmith, 1994;
Pegler and Das, 1996; Wang and Ou, 1998; Mai and Beroza,
2000; Stock and Smith, 2000; Henry and Das, 2001; Hanks
and Bakun, 2002, 2008; Kagan, 2002; Manighetti et al.,
2007; Blaser et al., 2010; Leonard, 2010; Strasser et al.,
2010) and regional data (e.g., Dowrick and Rhoades,
2004; Konstantinoua et al., 2005; Murotani et al., 2008;
Yen and Ma, 2011). These scaling relationships provide
