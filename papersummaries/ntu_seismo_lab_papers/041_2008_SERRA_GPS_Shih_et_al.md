Abstract A transition and subduction zone adjacent to
the Ryukyu Arc, Ryukyu Trench, and Okinawa Trough,
extends between southern Japan and northeastern Taiwan.
It is generated during the northwestward subduction of the
Philippine Sea Plate, which lies the Eurasian Plate along
the Ryukyu Trench. The movement of the Philippine Sea
Plate is hindered at the northeastern corner of Taiwan,
which causes complicated structure of the Philippine Sea
Plate at the western end of the Ryukyu subduction zone.
Development of the active subduction and transition
boundary near the western Ryukyu Arc is evaluated statistically by using displacements derived from GPS site
data. The statistical model shows that the absolute displacement derived from GPS measurements of nearly
8 years indicates a maximum spatial variation of 0.625 m.
Three trends are observed for such long-term progress, and
use of linear regression also reveals quite good consistency
between the data and statistic models. Such rate is also
elevated following the trend development. Southeastern
and nearly horizontal movement is suggested to the main

1 Introduction
Taiwan lies about 150 km east the Fukien coast of the
mainland China, separated from the latter by the Taiwan
Strait (Fig. 1). Taiwan Province is comprised of 81 islands
and islets. Geographically, Taiwan Province is represented
by the main island with 13 islands and scattered islets.
Taiwan is a member of the Ryukyu–Taiwan–Luzon arc
chain rimming the western border of the Pacific Ocean
(Fig. 2). The tectonic evolution of Taiwan can be attributed
either to the development of classic geosynclinal cycles or
to the interaction of crustal plates. In the geosynclinal
model, Taiwan is formed by a typical mobile or organic
Cenozoic geosynclinal deposition on a pre-Tertiary metamorphic basement filled with Tertiary sediments to a
thickness of more than 10,000 m. In the plate tectonic
model, the main island of Taiwan is situated on the junction between the continental Eurasian Plate on the west and
the ocea
