SUMMARY
In this paper we test whether or not structural and morphological features inherited from the
Eurasian continental margin are affecting the contemporary stress and strain fields in southcentral Taiwan. Principal stress directions (σ 1 , σ 2 and σ 3 ) are estimated from the inversion
of clustered earthquake focal mechanisms and the direction of the maximum compressive
horizontal stress (SH ) is calculated throughout the study area. From these data the most likely
fault plane orientations and their kinematics are inferred. The results of the stress inversion
are then discussed together with the directions of displacement, compressional strain rate
and maximum shear strain rate derived from GPS data. These data show that there is a
marked contrast in the direction of SH from north to south across the study area, with the
direction of SH remaining roughly subparallel to the relative plate motion vector in the north,
whereas in the south it rotates nearly 45◦ counter-clockwise. The direction of the horizontal
maximum compression strain rate (εH ) and associated maximum shear planes, together with
the displacement field display an overall similar pattern between them, although undergoing
a less marked rotation. We interpret the southward change in the SH , εH and the dextral
maximum shear plane directions, together with that of the horizontal displacement field to be
related to the reactivation of east–northeast striking faults inherited from the rifted Eurasian
margin and to the shelf/slope break. Inherited faults in the basement are typically reactivated
as strike-slip faults, whereas newly formed faults in the fold-and-thrust belt are commonly
thrusts or oblique thrusts. Eastwards, the stress inversions and strain data show that the western
flank of the Central Range is undergoing extension in the upper crust. SH in the Central Range
is roughly parallel to the relative plate convergence vector, but in southwestern T
