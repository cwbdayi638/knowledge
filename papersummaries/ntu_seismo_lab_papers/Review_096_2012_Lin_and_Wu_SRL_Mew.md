A Fast Magnitude Estimation for the 2011 M w 9.0
Great Tohoku Earthquake
by Ting-Li Lin and Yih-Min Wu
INTRODUCTION

METHOD AND DATA

After the occurrence of a large earthquake, rapid reporting
is useful and necessary for resource dispatch management
and quick damage assessment. In practice, a ground-motion
prediction or a shaking-intensity estimation can be realized
once the location and magnitude of an earthquake become
available. Rapid availability of event information can also
fulfill inquiries and alleviate the misgivings of the public
and media.
Using the traditional travel-time method, rapid earthquake location is a simple task once a few P-wave arrivals
are known. In contrast, a quick and accurate estimate of earthquake magnitude is a nontrivial problem, especially for an extremely large regional event. For a teleseismic-determined
moment magnitude, it may take tens of minutes for the propagation of teleseismic waves. For a method using first-arrival P
waveforms of broadband seismograms for moment magnitude
determinations (Tsuboi et al., 1995, 1999), the reporting time
for moderate-sized earthquakes still takes several minutes. In
addition, common high-gain broadband stations will suffer
a severe amplitude-clipping problem from regional large
earthquakes.
The M w 9.0 (Global Centroid Moment Tensor [CMT])
Tohoku-Chiho Taiheiyo-Oki (Tohoku) earthquake that
occurred on 11 March 2011 was unprecedented in size since
Japan started modern instrumental recordings 130 years ago.
The megathrust Tohoku earthquake ruptured the Pacific–
North American (Okhotsk) plate boundary off the Pacific
coast of northeastern Japan.
The work presented here employed the empirical method
of Wu and Teng (2004) for quick M w determinations of
crustal earthquakes in Japan using time integration over the
strong-shaking duration for absolute values of acceleration
records.
In the study of Wu and Teng (2004), the maximum magnitude was for the 1999 M w 7.6 (Global CMT) Chi-Chi
earthquake in Taiwan. In this work, the largest event was
the 2011 M w 9.0 Tohoku earthquake in Japan. We show that
the method of Wu and Teng (2004) can be applied for large
crustal earthquakes in Japan and even for extremely large events
such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake—one of the five largest
earthquakes that have occurred in the modern era—without a
saturation problem.

In this work, we only provide brief descriptions for the quick
M w determination. For more information, readers should refer
to the article of Wu and Teng (2004).
