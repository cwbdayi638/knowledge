a b s t r a c t
In this paper, we study (1) the spatial anomalies and (2) the temporal anomalies of soil gas in northern
Taiwan. The spatial anomalies of soil gas are related to tectonic faults, while the temporal anomalies of
soil gas are associated with pre-earthquake activities. Detailed soil gas sampling was systematically performed, and the analysis of the collected gas species shows that high helium and nitrogen concentrations
appear in samples from specific sites, which coincide with the structural setting of the area studied. This
analysis indicates the possibility of using these soil gases to determine fault zones in the studied area.
Based on the soil gas data, a station (Tapingti) for automatic soil gas monitoring was constructed on
an appropriate site at the fault zone. Some anomalous high radon concentrations at certain times can
be identified from the dataset, which was generated by the continuous monitoring of soil gas for over
a year. Notably, many of these anomalies were observed several hours to a few days before the earthquakes (ML > 3) that occurred in northern Taiwan. By combining the information of epicenters and fault
plane solutions of these earthquakes, we find that the shallow earthquakes (<15 km) were mainly strikeslip and normal-type earthquakes, and concentrated within a distance of 30 km to the monitoring site
(Group A). The deep earthquakes (>20 km) were mainly thrust-type earthquakes and distributed in
greater distances (>45 km) east of the monitoring site (Group B). Such focal mechanisms of earthquakes
suggest an extensional and compressional structural domain in the continental crust for Group A and
Group B earthquakes, respectively. It is suggested that the pre-earthquake activities associated with
the seismicity of Group B may be transmitted along the major decollement in the region below the
Tapingti station, leading to the observed soil gas enhancements.
