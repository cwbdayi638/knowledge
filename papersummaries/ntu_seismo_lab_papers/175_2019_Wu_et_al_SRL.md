ABSTRACT
On 6 February 2018, an M w 6.4 earthquake struck near the city
of Hualien, in eastern Taiwan with a focal depth of 10.4 km.
The earthquake caused strong shaking and severe damage to
many buildings in Hualien. The maximum intensity during this
earthquake reached VII (> 0:4g) in the epicentral region, which
is extreme in Taiwan and capable of causing damage in built
structures. About 17 people died and approximately 285 were
injured. Taiwan was one of the first countries to implement an
earthquake early warning (EEW) system that is capable of issuing a warning prior to strong shaking. In addition to the official
EEW run by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), a low-cost
EEW system (P-alert) has been deployed by National Taiwan
University (NTU). The P-alert network is currently operational
and is capable of providing on-site EEW as well as a map of
expected ground shaking. In the present work, we demonstrate
the performance of the P-alert network during the 2018
Hualien earthquake. The shake maps generated by the P-alert
network were available within 2 min and are in good agreement
with the patterns of observed damage in the area. These shake
maps provide insights into rupture directivity that are crucial
for earthquake engineering. During this earthquake, individual
P-alert stations acted as on-site EEWsystems and provided 2–8 s
lead time in the blind zone around the epicenter. The coseismic
deformation (C d ) is estimated using the records of P-alert stations. The higher C d values (C d > 2) in the epicentral region
are very helpful for authorities for the purpose of responding to
damage mitigation.

INTRODUCTION
Located on the western circum-Pacific seismic belt, Taiwan is
frequently struck by earthquakes. The collision between the
nearby Philippine Sea plate (PSP) and Eurasian plates (EP)
contributes to the complex geological features of Taiwan.
To the east of Taiwan, the PSP subducts northward under
the EP along the Ryukyu trench (Fig. 1a). To the southwest

of Taiwan, the EP subducts eastward under the PSP (Tsai et al.,
1977; Wu et al., 2008). Tectonically, most of Taiwan is under
northwest–southeast compression, with a measured convergence rate of ∼8 cm=yr (Yu et al., 1997). The damaging earthquakes happening in Taiwan can be divided into two
categories, those associated with the plate boundary and the
others associated with active faults in western Taiwan (Wu
et al., 1999).
The Hualien earthquake is located in northeastern Taiwan, where seismic activity is due to the subduction of the
PSP under the EP. In the neighborhood of the epicenter, there
is the Milun fault (Fig. 1a). It caused an M 7.3 earthquake in
October 1951, although it has not been active for the p
