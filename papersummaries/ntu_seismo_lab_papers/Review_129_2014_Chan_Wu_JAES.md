a b s t r a c t
Following the 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake, a large amount of seismicity occurred in the Nantou
region of central Taiwan. Among the seismic activities, eight Mw P 5.8 earthquakes took place following
the Chi-Chi earthquake, whereas only four earthquakes with comparable magnitudes took place from
1900 to 1998. Since the seismicity rate during the Chi-Chi postseismic period has never returned to
the background level, such seismicity activation cannot simply be attributed to modiﬁed Omori’s Law
decay. In this work, we attempted to associate seismic activities with stress evolution. Based on our work,
it appears that the spatial distribution of the consequent seismicity can be associated with increasing
coseismic stress. On the contrary, the stress changes imparted by the afterslip; lower crust–upper mantle
viscoelastic relaxation; and sequent events resulted in a stress drop in most of the study region.
Understanding seismogenic mechanisms in terms of stress evolution would be beneﬁcial to seismic
hazard mitigation.

1. Introduction
Two large earthquakes struck the Nantou region of central Taiwan in 2013. A Mw 5.8 earthquake occurred on March 27th, 2013
(Fig. 1). The Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN)
observed the largest intensity of VI near the epicenter. The event
resulted in one fatality, ninety-seven injuries, and loss of property.
Two months later, on June 2nd, another earthquake of Mw 6.3 took
place in the vicinity (Fig. 1). The event caused a comparable intensity and led to a loss of property and human life. In addition to
these two events in 2013, another six earthquakes with
Mw P 6.0 took place in this region following the 1999 Mw 7.6
Chi-Chi earthquake (Fig. 1). For the purpose of seismic hazard mitigation, it is crucial to determine seismogenic mechanisms in this
region.
Seismic behaviors could be controlled by stress evolution. Ma
et al. (2005) calculated the Coulomb stress change (DCFS) imparted
by the Chi-Chi coseismic ruptures, and analyzed seismicity in
Taiwan during the subsequent 53 months. They concluded that
during this period the DCFS caused by the Chi-Chi earthquake
dominated Taiwan seismic activities. Chan and Stein (2009) evaluated the stress evol
