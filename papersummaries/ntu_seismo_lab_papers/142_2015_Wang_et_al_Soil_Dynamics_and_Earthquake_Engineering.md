It is understood that sample size could be an issue in earthquake statistical studies, causing the best
estimate being too deterministic or less representative derived from limited statistics from observation.
Like many Bayesian analyses and estimates, this study shows another novel application of the Bayesian
approach to earthquake engineering, using prior data to help compensate the limited observation for the
target problem to estimate the magnitude of the recurring Meishan earthquake in central Taiwan. With
the Bayesian algorithms developed, the Bayesian analysis suggests that the next major event induced by
the Meishan fault in central Taiwan should be in Mw 6.44 7 0.33, based on one magnitude observation of
Mw 6.4 from the last event, along with the prior data including fault length of 14 km, rupture width of
15 km, rupture area of 216 km2, average displacement of 0.7 m, slip rate of 6 mm/yr, and ﬁve earthquake
empirical models.

1. Introduction
The region around Taiwan is known for high seismicity, not to
mention a catastrophic event like the Mw 7.6 Chi–Chi earthquake
could recur in decades [1]. Recently, there are studies suggesting that
the return period of a major earthquake induced by the Meishan
fault in central Taiwan might be as short as 160 years, not to mention
the very last Meishan earthquake in 1906 was occurring more than
one hundred years ago. Under the circumstances, the risk of the
active fault inducing a major earthquake in near future is considered
relatively high, and the subject has been discussed in several recent
studies [2,3]. Therefore, from a different perspective with new
methodology, the target problem of this study is to evaluate the
magnitude of the next Meishan earthquake in central Taiwan that
could occur in near future given its short return period. More
introductions to the background of the Meishan fault in central
Taiwan are given in one of the following sections.
One possibility to evaluate such a problem is via statistical
study. But on the other hand, it is understood that sample size is
important to statistical assessments and inferences. For example,
