Human life and property are threatened by devastating earthquakes. As a result, seismic hazard mitigation is an important issue for seismologists, earthquake engineers, and
related scientists. Probabilistic seismic hazard assessments

mic mitigation policies (e.g., building codes and the site selection of pubic structures) (McGuire, 2001). Therefore, scientists in different fields are currently attempting to build
reliable systems for PSHAs on different spatial scales. For
