1. Introduction

The September20, 1999, Taiwan earthquakeoccurrednear
the town of Chi-Chi in the west-centralpart of the island(Fig.
1). It was a disastrousevent and is the largest known
earthquakeon the island.The causativefault, the Chelungpu
fault (Fig. 1), is essentiallythe westernboundingfault of the
mountains.This generallyeast-dippingfault was recognized
as activein the recentlypublishedactivefault map (Changet.
al., 1998), howeverit was presumedto have been inactivein
the last 100,000 years,basedon an estimatedage of alluvium
underthe tip of the thrust. Certainly no historicaldamaging
earthquakewas known to have occurredon the fault sincethe

of the surfacetraceis about77 km, strikingN-S alongmostof
