hazards. Its timely information is therefore of great importance for early shaking alerts and emergency
responses. To this end, we test the feasibility of using near-ﬁeld (<25 km) ground motion data from a dense
low-cost seismic network in Taiwan to constrain directivity information and provide warning for far-ﬁeld
areas. The method is simple and robust, based on the real-time shaking map interpolation and directional
attenuation regression analysis. Applications to 16 moderate- to large-magnitude earthquakes in Taiwan and
California show that the directivity can be stably obtained within 17 s and agrees well with previous studies
when available. An indicator of the strength of directivity ampliﬁcation is also deﬁned and reveals a
prevalence of strong directivity effect for ML ≥ 6.0 earthquakes in Taiwan. Such near-real-time directivity
information can therefore be useful in earthquake early warning systems for providing more accurate ground
shaking alerts.

Plain Language Summary When earthquake rupture propagates in a preferential direction, the
ground motions in that direction can be greatly ampliﬁed and cause serious earthquake-related damage.
The timely knowledge of the rupture direction and possible ampliﬁed ground shaking areas is therefore
crucial to risk assessme
