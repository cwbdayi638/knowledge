Abstract
A series of earthquakes that struck Taiwan’s southern Longitudinal Valley on September 17 and 18, 2022 severely dam‑
aged several buildings in Taitung and Hualien. The Chishang earthquake, which had a magnitude of ­ML 6.8 and a large
foreshock with a magnitude of ­ML 6.6 the day before, was the mainshock in this sequence. The strongest intensity
reported in the epicentral region during this earthquake sequence, which was 6 + , is the highest ever recorded
since the Central Weather Bureau (CWB, renamed as the Central Weather Administration since September 15, 2023)
revised its seismic intensity scale. National Taiwan University (NTU) has operated a low-cost earthquake early warn‑
ing (EEW) system known as the P-Alert for a decade. In this study, we demonstrate the performance of the P-Alert
network during the 2022 Chishang earthquake and the largest foreshock. The P-Alert network plotted shake maps
during these earthquakes that displayed various values within 5 min. The high shaking areas on these maps were
in good agreement with observed damages during this earthquake, providing valuable insights into rupture directiv‑
ity, a crucial component of earthquake engineering. Individual P-Alert stations acted as on-site EEW systems and pro‑
vided a lead time of 3–10 s within the blind zone of CWB. For the ­ML 6.8 mainshock, there was a lead time of at least
5 s, even up to 10 s, demonstrating their effectiveness in the blind zone. The P-Alert regional EEW system provided
the first report about 9 s and 7 s after the mainshock and the largest foreshock occurrence, respectively, with esti‑
mated magnitudes of 5.74 and 5.67. The CWB system estimated magnitudes of 6.72 and 6.16 in the first report,
respectively, about 7 s and 9 s after the earthquake occurrence. The timeliness of the two systems were not signifi‑
cantly different. Despite the effectiveness of the P-Alert network, data loss due to connection interruptions prompted
us to develop a new compact data logger for improved data availability.
