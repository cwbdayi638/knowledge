From the literature, we found that PGV–PD3 regressions for on-site earthquake early warning (EEW) can
be quite different depending on the presumption whether or not PGV–PD3 data from different regions
should be “mixable” in regression analyses. As a result, this becomes a source of epistemic uncertainty in
the selection of a PGV–PD3 empirical relationship for on-site EEW. This study is aimed at examining the
inﬂuence of this epistemic uncertainty on EEW decision-making, and demonstrating it with an example
on the use of PGV–PD3 models developed with data from Taiwan, Japan, and Southern California. The
analysis shows that using the “global” PGV–PD3 relationship for Southern California would accompany a
more conservative EEW decision-making (i.e., early warning is activated more frequently) than using the
local empirical model developed with the PGV–PD3 data from Southern California only. However, the
inﬂuence of this epistemic uncertainty on EEW is not that obvious for the cases of Taiwan and Japan.

1. Introduction
Earthquake prediction has been proved a controversial subject
given those recent catastrophic earthquakes unpredicted [1].
Under the circumstances, alternatives such as seismic hazard
analysis and earthquake early warning are accepted as a more
practical approach for earthquake risk mitigation [1–8]. In short,
seismic hazard analysis is to best estimate an earthquake ground
motion at the site with earthquake data such as seismicity and
fault locations; by contrast, earthquake early warning is a realtime approach sending out warning messages and taking timely
responses before the arrival of destructive motions.
Uncertainty plays a key role in an analysis and decisionmaking. Nowadays, two types of uncertainty are generally categorized [9]. The ﬁrst is the aleatory uncertainty resulting from
natural randomness, such as random earthquake sizes and locations. In contrast, the other type is the epistemic uncertainty
owing to our imperfect knowledge, and a common instance about
epistemic uncertainty in earthquake studies is in the selections of
suitable ground motion models for a speciﬁc application given so
many empirical models are available [10–13].
