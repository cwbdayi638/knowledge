This paper presents a new copula-based earthquake early warning (EEW) decision-making strategy, aiming to
characterize missed-alarm and false-alarm probabilities for an on-site EEW and determine an optimum threshold
at which EEW should be set oﬀ with the lowest missed-alarm and false-alarm probabilities combined. On the
basis of an existing PD3-PGV (PD3: peak ground displacement within the ﬁrst three seconds after P-wave arrives;
PGV: peak ground velocity) on-site EEW, the analysis shows that a copula model consisting of the Lognormal
distribution, Weibull distribution, and Frank copula can satisfactorily model the PD3-PGV joint probability
distribution. Accordingly, the optimum PD3 triggering thresholds for diﬀerent PGV warning thresholds from 5 to
35 cm/s are presented for future references in the use of the PD3-PGV on-site EEW with maximum reliability.

1. Introduction
From recent events, it is a fact that we cannot predict earthquakes
for eﬀective hazard mitigation. The main reason for not being able to
predict earthquakes is that we cannot monitor the stress and strain
conditions of rock a few kilometers below the ground surface where the
focal points are located [1]. As a result, several methods were developed for seismic hazard mitigation, such as seismic hazard assessment
based on geological and seismological data. For example, Wang et al.
[2] conducted a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) for Taipei
city, estimating the levels of PGA (peak ground acceleration) that the
sites could encounter considering diﬀerent periods of time. Other PSHA
case studies include those by Ayele [3], Silacheva et al. [4], and Nakajima et al. [5], all aiming to best estimate earthquake-induced PGA
(or SA: spectral acceleration) in diﬀerent return periods for preparing a
corresponding earthquake-resistant design for the target sites.
Unlike seismic hazard analysis that develops site-speciﬁc earthquake-resistant designs considering earthquake uncertainties, earthquake early warning (EEW) aims to detect and interpret an occurring
earthquake as early as possible, then disseminate warning messages to
the public before the arrival of peak earthquake motions (mainly utilizing the nature that radio waves can trav
