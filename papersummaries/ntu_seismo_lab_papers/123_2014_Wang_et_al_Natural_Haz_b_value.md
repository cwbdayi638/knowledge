Abstract Since the year 1973, more than 54,000 Mw C 3.0 earthquakes have occurred
around Taiwan, and their magnitude–frequency relationship was found following with the
Gutenberg–Richter recurrence law with b value equal to 0.923 from the least-square calculation. However, using this b value with the McGuire–Arabasz algorithm results in some
disagreement between observations and expectations in magnitude probability. This study
introduces a simple approach to optimize the b value for better modeling of the magnitude
probability, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in this paper. The result shows that the
optimal b value can better model the observed magnitude distribution, compared with two
customary methods. For example, given magnitude threshold = 5.0 and maximum magnitude = 8.0, the optimal b value of 0.835 is better than 0.923 from the least-square
calculation and 0.913 from maximum likelihood estimation for simulating the earthquake’s
magnitude probability distribution around Taiwan.
