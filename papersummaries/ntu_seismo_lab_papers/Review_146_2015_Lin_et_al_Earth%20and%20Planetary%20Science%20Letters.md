a b s t r a c t
Landslides have become one of the most deadly natural disasters on earth, not only due to a signiﬁcant
increase in extreme climate change caused by global warming, but also rapid economic development in
topographic relief areas. How to detect landslides using a real-time system has become an important
question for reducing possible landslide impacts on human society. However, traditional detection of
landslides, either through direct surveys in the ﬁeld or remote sensing images obtained via aircraft or
satellites, is highly time consuming. Here we analyze very long period seismic signals (20–50 s) generated
by large landslides such as Typhoon Morakot, which passed though Taiwan in August 2009. In addition to
successfully locating 109 large landslides, we deﬁne landslide seismic magnitude based on an empirical
formula: Lm = log( A ) + 0.55 log() + 2.44, where A is the maximum displacement (μm) recorded at
one seismic station and  is its distance (km) from the landslide. We conclude that both the location
and seismic magnitude of large landslides can be rapidly estimated from broadband seismic networks for
both academic and applied purposes, similar to earthquake monitoring. We suggest a real-time algorithm
be set up for routine monitoring of landslides in places where they pose a frequent threat.

1. Introduction
Catastrophic landslides can not only destroy many human lives,
but also have strong economic, social, and political impacts on
many countries. For example, a huge number of landslides were
triggered by the extremely heavy rainfall (>3000 mm) caused by
the synergistic effect of both Typhoon Morakot and the southwestern monsoon in Taiwan in August 2009 (Lin et al., 2010;
Tsou et al., 2011; Kuo et al., 2011). One of the most deadly of
these landslides buried 474 residents in the Hsiaolin village of
southern Taiwan. Based on a detailed investigation (Chen et al.,
2011), the disaster process could be clearly divided into two major
parts
