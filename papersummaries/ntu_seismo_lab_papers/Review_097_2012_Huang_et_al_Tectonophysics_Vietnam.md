a b s t r a c t
The 900-km-long Red River shear zone (RRSZ) lends a compelling support to the continental extrusion model
for the tectonic evolution of southeastern Asia, but has been challenged by many of views, as some new
records mainly from northern Vietnam, suspecting the dimensions of RRSZ neither in depth nor in
displacement are as large as we expected before. However, compared to the northwestern half of the RRSZ in
Yunnan province better studied by many ﬁelds, the southeastern half in northern Vietnam is relatively poorly
constrained by seismic study, due to insufﬁcient stations and data in the past. This study, using a newly
deployed portable broadband seismic network, obtained the ﬁrst local seismic tomography with a stepwise
inversion using P and Pn phases. Surface geology, major structures, and rock properties are well correlated
and identiﬁed in our model, suggesting the RRSZ is a lithospheric structure at least penetrating to the
uppermost mantle with mantle thermal anomalies. In general, the crust of northern Vietnam appears to be
weak and sits on a relatively hot uppermost mantle, showing a long and complex thermo tectonic history. A
mid-lower crustal segmentation of RRSZ is also proposed to compromise the discrepancies recently observed
between Yunnan province and northern Vietnam.

1. Introduction
The Red River shear zone (RRSZ) is one of the most profound
geologic features in southeastern Asia, which extends over 900 km
from southeastern edge of the Tibetan plateau to the Tonkin Gulf,
northern Vietnam, and as far as the South China Sea. With 500–900 km
in extensive left lateral displacement (Chung et al., 1997; Lan et al.,
2001; Leloup et al., 1995), and the onset time of 21–27 Ma after the
beginning of India–Eurasia collision ca. 50 Ma (Leloup et al., 1995;
Tapponnier et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1998, 2000), the RRSZ provides
prominent, original evidence for the continental extrusion model
(Tapponnier et al., 1982, 1986), which attributes a signiﬁcant amount
of continental s
