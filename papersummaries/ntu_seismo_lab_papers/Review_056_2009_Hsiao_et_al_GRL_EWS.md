Development of earthquake early warning system in Taiwan

[1] With the implementation of a real-time strong-motion
network by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), an earthquake
early warning (EEW) system has been developed in Taiwan.
In order to shorten the earthquake response time, a virtual
sub-network method based on the regional early warning
approach was utilized at first stage. Since 2001, this EEW
system has responded to a total of 225 events with
magnitude greater than 4.5 occurred inland or off the
coast of Taiwan. The system is capable of issuing an
earthquake report within 20 sec of its occurrence with good
magnitude estimations for events up to magnitude 6.5.
Currently, a P-wave method is adopted by the CWB system.
Base on the results from 596 M  4.0 earthquakes recorded
by the real-time strong-motion network, we found that peak
displacement amplitudes from initial P waves (Pd) can be
used for the identification of M  6.0 events. Characteristic
of the initial P waves can be used for
periods t c and t max
p
magnitude determination with an uncertainty less than 0.4.
We expect to achieve a 10-second response time by the
EEW system in Taiwan in the near future. Citation: Hsiao,

1. Introduction
[2] Taiwan is located on the western portion of the
Circum-Pacific seismic belt. The Philippine Sea plate subducts northward under the Eurasia plate along the Ryukyu
trench. The Eurasia plate subducts eastward under the
Philippine Sea plate off the southern tip of Taiwan. Most
of Taiwan is under a northwest –southeast compression with
a measured convergence rate of about 8 cm/year. Many
disastrous earthquakes have occurred in the past. Figure 1
shows the distribution of disastrous earthquakes in Taiwan
since 1900. A real-time strong-motion network has been
installed by the CWB since 1995 for seismic hazard
mitigation purpose. With the subsequent developments of
the past decade, this network has been utilized for rapid
report of felt earthquakes [Shin et al., 1996; Wu et al., 1997]
and for developing Taiwan’s EEW system [Wu et al., 1998,
1999; Wu and Teng, 2002; Hsiao, 2007].
[3] Currently, EEW system is regarded as a useful tool
for real-time seismic hazard mitigation. An EEW system
