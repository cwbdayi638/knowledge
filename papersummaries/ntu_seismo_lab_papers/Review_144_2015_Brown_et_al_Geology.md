of these rocks may have been metamorphosed
under blueschist and/or eclogite facies conditions. Some high-pressure terranes form large,
coherent units, while in others the high-pressure
rocks are in smaller units as part of a tectonic
mélange (a structural mixture of rock types of
different metamorphic grades) (Kylander-Clark
et al., 2013; Ernst, 2005).
HIGH-PRESSURE ROCKS IN EASTERN
TAIWAN
Arc-continent collision has been taking place
in Taiwan (Fig. 1) since the latest Miocene as
the result of the subduction of the Eurasia plate
beneath the Luzon arc on the Philippine Sea
plate (Sibuet and Hsu, 2004). To the immediate west of the colliding volcanic arc, the faultbounded Yuli belt (Fig. 1) forms a tectonic
mélange that comprises predominantly greenschist facies quartz mica schist with isolated
occurrences of metamorphosed oceanic crust,
amphibolite, blueschist, and omphacite-zoisite
metabasite with serpentinite (Keyser, 2015; Tsai
et al., 2013; Sun et al., 1998; Yui and Lo, 1989;
Liou, 1981). The age of peak metamorphism of
the high-pressure rocks is not well constrained,
but is thought to be between 5 and 14 Ma (e.g.,
Beyssac et al., 2008). Pressure and temperature
estimates for the quartz-mica schist, the blueschist, and the omphacite-zoisite metabasite
range from 0.6 to 1.7 GPa, and 400 to 550 °C
(Keyser, 2015; Tsai et al., 2013; Beyssac et al.,
2008). Apatite fission track ages in the Yuli belt
range from ca. 0.9 to 0.4 Ma, suggesting exhumation rates of 3–12 mm yr–1 (Willett et al.,
2003; Dadson et al., 2003), much higher than
those of the metamorphic rocks to the west or
the unmetamorphosed volcanic arc to the east.

INTRODUCTION
Detailed studies of a large number of subduction-related high-pressure rock terranes, in
combination with numerical modeling, indicate
that various mechanisms may explain how these
terranes are exhumed to Earth’s surface (Erdman
and Lee, 2014; Hacker and Gerya, 2013; Warren, 2013; Agard et al., 2009; Gerya et al., 2002).
Despite noteworthy advances, there is still debate,
and a significant number of unknowns, about the
mechanisms of exhumation (Erdman and Lee,
2014; Warren, 2013; Hacker and Gerya, 2013). To
help narrow the gap on these unknowns, important objectives for future research have been proposed, among which is the imaging of actively
exhuming high-pressure terranes (Hacker and
