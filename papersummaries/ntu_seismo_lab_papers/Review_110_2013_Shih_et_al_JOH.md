s u m m a r y
It was found that groundwater can be ﬂuctuated by a variety of disturbances. For instance, seismic activity inducing the dilatation of earth can disturb groundwater level ﬂuctuation as observed in groundwater
wells. In this research, spectral analysis in the frequency domain was used to quantitatively evaluate
coherence between groundwater head ﬂuctuations and the ground motions recorded in Taiwan from a
distant earthquake, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in northern Honshu, Japan with magnitude of 9. The
relationship between groundwater ﬂuctuations and the decomposed ground motions of Rayleigh waves
are clearly identiﬁed. By analyzing autospectral density, cross-spectral density, and resultant coherence
for the seismograms and groundwater head, it was found that the Rayleigh waves dominated the groundwater ﬂuctuations at period of about 21–32 s for six pair of groundwater and seismograms of broadband
distributed around Taiwan; ﬂuctuations of groundwater are highly coherent with the radial and vertical
components of ground motions. Our analysis also shows the time from event to station for Rayleigh
waves ranged from 780 to 900 s approximately. Wave parameter for seismic event to station of groundwater and seismograms were also identiﬁed as 3.0–3.5 km/s and 64–110 km for wave velocity and wave
length, respectively. The relationship of groundwater ﬂuctuations and ground motions induced by seismic activity become feasible to assess using spectral analysis.

1. Introduction
The study demonstrates that the polarities of the observed
coseismic water-level and river discharge changes are in good
agreement with those of the static volumetric strain calculated
by a dislocation model, using the well-constrained rupture model
of the seismogenic Chelungpu fault (Lee et al., 2002). Analysis of
strong-motion instrument recordings in Seattle, Washington,
resulting from the 2002 Mw 7.9 Denali, Alaska, earthquake reveals
that ampliﬁcation in the 0.2–1.0 Hz frequency band is largely governed by the shallow sediments both inside a
