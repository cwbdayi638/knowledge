Flooding resulting from the bursting of dams formed by landquake events such as rock avalanches,
landslides and debris flows can lead to serious bank erosion and inundation of populated areas near
rivers. Seismic waves can be generated by landquake events which can be described as time-dependent
forces (unloading/reloading cycles) acting on the Earth. In this study, we conduct inversions of longperiod (LP, period ≥20 s) waveforms for the landquake force histories (LFHs) of ten events, which
provide quantitative characterization of the initiation, propagation and termination stages of the slope
failures. When the results obtained from LP waveforms are analyzed together with high-frequency (HF,
1–3 Hz) seismic signals, we find a relatively strong late-arriving seismic phase (dubbed Dam-forming
phase or D-phase) recorded clearly in the HF waveforms at the closest stations, which potentially marks
the time when the collapsed masses sliding into river and perhaps even impacting the topographic
barrier on the opposite bank. Consequently, our approach to analyzing the LP and HF waveforms
developed in this study has a high potential for identifying five dam-forming landquake events (DFLEs)
in near real-time using broadband seismic records, which can provide timely warnings of the impending
floods to downstream residents.
The formation of a landquake dam results from the natural blockage of the river channels by mass wasting from
hillslopes. The existence time of a landquake dam directly determines the seriousness of the subsequent dam
breaching. In the global catalog of landquake dam failures, 27% of the landquake dams failed within a day after
formation1. Due to the insufficient reaction time, the failure of a landquake dam often results in loss of lives. For
example, a catastrophic Shiaolin landquake occurred during the passage of the 2009 Typhoon Morakot across
Taiwan, which resulted in 465 deaths in Shiaolin Village and the short-lived (~104 minutes) landquake dam
blocking the Chishan River2. For potentially large landquake dams, early identification of DFLEs is essential to
organizing appropriate preventive actions in due time.
Seismic sources can be described in the point-source approximation by a symmetric second-order moment
tensor (MT) that can be decomposed into pure double-couple (DC), compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD)
and isotropic (ISO) components3,4. However, source mechanisms of non-fault earthquakes (i.e. landquakes) cannot be parameterized by a moment tensor (MT). In the past decade, force time functions of sinusoidal shape have
been widely used to study Earth surface processes such as glacial earthquakes5,6 and landquakes7–10. Long-period
data have be
