We systematically investigate the spatiotemporal water storage changes in Taiwan using geodetic
(GNSS and GRACE) and hydrological (precipitation, GLDAS and LSDM assimilation models, and insitu groundwater level) datasets. We use GNSS-observed vertical deformation to estimate water
storage changes based on elastic loading theory and weighted least-squares inversion, correcting for
contributions from global loads using GRACE. The mean annual water-thickness change inferred from
GNSS across Taiwan is 0.53 ± 0.17 m and the largest seasonal change of up to 0.91 m is estimated in
southwest Taiwan. Comparison of the geodetic and hydrological data shows that the spatial pattern
of annual water storage change estimated from GNSS, GLDAS, and precipitation data are generally
consistent, indicating signiﬁcant seasonal water-load ﬂuctuations in Taiwan. However, the GRACE solution
signiﬁcantly underestimates the amplitude of water mass change in Taiwan due to leakage effect, but
temporally correlates well with GNSS estimates. Hydrological assimilation model GLDAS, dominated
by shallow soil moisture variations, predicts that the average seasonal variation of water thickness is
only about 17% of GNSS estimates. This value is about half of the mean annual LSDM water storage
change of 0.18 m including an estimate of both soil moisture and surface water. The discrepancy
suggests that the contribution of groundwater is substantial and the total water storage change in
the hydrological assimilation model is underestimated in Taiwan. The spatiotemporal distributions
derived using independent component analysis (ICA) are generally consistent between the geodetic and
hydrological data. However, comparisons of seasonal amplitudes and phases between all data pairs reveal
different response times to precipitation, reﬂecting the complex nature of
