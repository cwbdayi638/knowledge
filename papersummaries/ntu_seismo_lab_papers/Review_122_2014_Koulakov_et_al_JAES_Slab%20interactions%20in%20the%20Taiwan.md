a b s t r a c t
We present a new model of P- and S-velocity anomalies in the upper mantle beneath the Taiwan region
based on the inversion of travel time data from the global International Seismological Center (ISC) catalog. We clearly observed the anomalies of high P- and S-velocities associated with the subducting plates
beneath the Ryukyu and Luzon arcs. At depths in the range of 100–200 km, the anomalies related to both
slabs seem to be connected, which might be evidence of the lithosphere collision of the two oppositely
oriented subduction zones. This model has been carefully veriﬁed using different synthetic tests. Based
on the derived seismic model, we propose a model of recent plate reconstructions in the region around
Taiwan. Initially, we presume the existence of two oppositely oriented subduction zones underneath the
Luzon Island and the Ryukyu arc, separated with a transform fault. The NW movement of the Philippine
Sea Plate led to ﬁrst a shortening and then a disappearance of this transform fault. As a result, the edge of
the Luzon arc collided with the edge of the Ryukyu arc. Simple simulations indicate that in this edge area,
very strong stresses and deformation might take place that result in signiﬁcant shortening of the earth
surface. We believe that the origin of the Taiwan island was caused by the collisional processes due to
the interaction of the two subduction zones. Note that in this case, no other conditions, such as the existence of arcs and/or buoyant continental crustal blocks, are required to explain the origin of the thick,
strongly shortened crust in Taiwan.

1. Introduction
The Taiwan area is greatly affected by active tectonic processes,
which result in wide-spread seismicity and moderate volcanism.
The 26 December 2006 Pingtung earthquake (Mw = 7.1 in the USGS
catalog) and the historical records of seismicity had proved that
the actively deforming accretionary wedge is capable of generating
large, and most likely great, earthquakes. Recently, the USGS issued
a report assessing the potential risk of a tsunami sourc
