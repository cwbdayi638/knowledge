Key Points:
• W
 e observe both coseismic dv/v
drops and strong seasonal dv/v
variations through a 20-year
systematic analysis in Taiwan
• The rainfall-induced pore pressure
change is likely the primary control
of the seasonal dv/v variations in
the crust
• Evaluating the environmental
influences on dv/v allows us to
isolate crustal damage related to
earthquakes

Abstract Ambient noise interferometry is a powerful technique to continuously measuring crustal
seismic velocity changes (dv/v) and studying crustal behaviors over time. However, the interpretation of
such dv/v variations is not straightforward since multiple causes including internal (tectonic/magmatic)
processes of the crust and external (environmental) factors could both affect dv/v simultaneously. To
differentiate the interplay between the internal and external processes in dv/v variations is an essential
step toward accurate crustal monitoring. In this study, we apply the single-station cross-component (SC)
method to 15 selected stations from the Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS) to investigate
the temporal evolution of crustal seismic velocities across Taiwan. We process the continuous BATS
seismic recording from 1998 to 2019, construct the daily SC correlation functions, and compute dv/v
values by the stretching technique in a frequency band of 0.1–0.9 Hz. We observe both strong annual
dv/v variations and co-seismic velocity drops associated with regional moderate-to-large earthquakes
