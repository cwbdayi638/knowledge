The use of characteristic period tc and peak displacement amplitude Pd of the initial P wave in
earthquake early warning (EEW) was proposed by Wu and Kanamori [1–4]. Here we apply this
approach to strong-motion records from a building sensor array installed in Taitung County, Taiwan.
This building was damaged during the 2006 Mw =6.1 Taitung earthquake with a peak ground velocity
(PGV) of up to 38.4 cm/s at an epicentral distance of 14.5 km. According to our analysis, the peak
displacement amplitude Pd is a better indicator for the destructiveness of an earthquake than tc
because tc is more sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than Pd. In accordance with previous
studies, only the structurally damaging Taitung earthquake generated a Pd value larger than 0.5 cm (a
threshold for identifying damaging events). Using Pd as an indicator for destructive earthquakes does
not lead to missing or false alarms for EEW purposes.

1. Introduction
Taiwan is located on the western circum-Paciﬁc seismic belt
with a measured plate boundary convergence rate of about 8 cm/
year [5] and has been repeatedly hit by damaging earthquakes [6].
Some of the disastrous events have inﬂicted severe casualties and
great property losses. In all likelihood the damages caused by
earthquakes will continue and even increase as the population
and the economy grow. It is therefore crucial for Taiwan to seek
means for alleviating the earthquake losses through scientiﬁc
research. EEW system has become one of the most effective
tools for real-time seismic hazard mitigation [7]. In a wellestablished EEW system, the characteristic period tc and the peak
displacement amplitude Pd of the initial P wave are two
important parameters, and they have been used to determine
the magnitudes and the shaking intensity [1–4,8–11] of earthquakes. Furthermore, the parameter Pd can also be used for
magnitude estimation for EEW purpose [12,13]. Frequent earthquakes and abundant high-quality near-ﬁeld strong-motion
records in Taiwan provide valuable data for examining the
efﬁcacy of the tc and Pd methods for practical earthquake early
warning purpose.
