Revised ML Determination for Crustal Earthquakes in Taiwan
by Yih-Min Wu, Richard M. Allen, and Chien-Fu Wu

Abstract The local magnitude scale ML is an empirically derived scale anchored
to a zero magnitude reference event. Richter defined the amplitude of ground shaking
at an epicentral distance of 100 km for a zero magnitude earthquake in southern
California. The crustal attenuation characteristics of Taiwan result in a relatively
high ML when compared to moment magnitude, Mw. We therefore define a revised
ML scale for crustal earthquakes in the Taiwan region that is more consistent with
Mw. Using observed peak ground shaking and Mw, we determine a new log A0 curve
of ground shaking versus hypocentral distance, R, for a zero magnitude earthquake,
and station correction factors. The log A0 curve determined in this study is,
log A0 (R) ⳱ 0.332 ⳮ 1.568 • log(R) Ⳳ 0.280.
Using this new log A0 curve and station corrections, the new ML is more consistent
with Mw, with a 0.2 magnitude unit uncertainty. The new log A0 curve has a value
of ⳮ2.80 at the distance of 100 km compared to the anchor point of log A0 ⳱ ⳮ3
at the same distance as defined by Richter for southern California. This means that
the current ML estimates in Taiwan (which use Richter’s definition) average 0.2
magnitude units larger than their Mw. The station correction factors also determined
are large, from ⳮ0.40 to 0.52 magnitude units. The use of station corrections in
routine seismic network operation in Taiwan will improve magnitude estimates. This
is particularly important for smaller events when recording stations may be predominantly on either hard rock or soft soil sites, which could lead to under- or
overestimates of the magnitude by up to half a magnitude unit.

Introduction
There are many magnitude scales in current use. Local
magnitude, ML, introduced by Richter (1935) is still popular
with earthquake monitoring agencies (Alsaker et al., 1991;
Shin, 1993; Spallarossa et al., 2002; Wu et al., 1997) because of the relative ease of measurement and its direct relation to the strength of shaking at the period range of most
importance to the built environment (Kanamori and Jennings, 1978). However, ML is an empirically derived scale
based on the observed strength of shaking for earthquakes
in southern California. Other magnitude scales provide better representations of some important event characteristics.
In particular, moment magnitude, Mw, is related to the seismic moment released during an event.
Determination of ML is based on the amplitude recorded
by a Wood–Anderson torsion seismograph with a natural
period of 0.8 sec, a damping constant 0.8, and a static magnification of 2800. By definition, in a zero magnitude earthquake in southern California a Wood–Anderson instrument
100 km from the epicenter would record ground shaking
with a peak amplitude of 0.00
