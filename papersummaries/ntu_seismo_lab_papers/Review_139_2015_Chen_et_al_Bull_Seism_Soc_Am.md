The Earthworm Based Earthquake Alarm Reporting System in Taiwan
by Da-Yi Chen,* Nai-Chi Hsiao, and Yih-Min Wu

Abstract

For more than 10 years, the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan has operated an earthquake early warning (EEW) system and has issued warnings for specific
agencies. For the past two years, the Earthworm platform has been used to integrate
real-time seismic data streams from different types of seismic stations and to monitor
seismicity in Taiwan. Using the Earthworm platform, the Earthworm Based Earthquake Alarm Reporting (eBEAR) system is currently in development for shortening
reporting times and improving the accuracy of warnings for EEW purposes. The
eBEAR system consists of new Earthworm modules for managing P-wave phase picking, trigger associations, hypocenter locations, magnitude estimations, and alert filtering prior to broadcasting. Here, we outline the methodology and performance of the
eBEAR system. To calibrate the eBEAR system, an offline test was implemented using 154 earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from M L 4.0 to 6.5. In a comparison of
online performance using the current EEW system, the eBEAR system reduced reporting times and improved the accuracy of offshore earthquake locations and magnitudes.
Online performance of the eBEAR system indicated that the average reporting times
afforded by the system are approximately 15 and 26 s for inland and offshore earthquakes, respectively. The eBEAR system now delivers warnings to elementary and
junior high schools in Taiwan.

Introduction
tall), crashed and dropped to the ground. The 2010 M w 6.3
Jiasian earthquake brought strong ground motions to
southern Taiwan, causing an operating Taiwan High Speed
Rail train to run off its tracks (Huang et al., 2011; Wu et al.,
2011). Given these types of incidents in Taiwan, a reliable
and fast EEW system is urgently needed to provide early
warnings for the next large earthquake.
Over the years, many studies have been conducted
regarding the development of an EEW system in Taiwan. In
1995, an earthquake rapid reporting system began operating
on the basis of 16-bit strong-motion seismometers and was a
type of early-stage EEW system for Taiwan (Wu et al., 1997).
Although the system could not issue warnings prior to large
ground shaking, it provided rapid reporting within 102 s for
the Chi-Chi earthquake and was the leading technology at
that time (Wu et al., 2000). As EEW system necessity demanded, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) was the first to
test an EEW prototype system within the Hualien area in
Taiwan. To reduce reporting times and provide early warnings for distant metropolitan regions, a new idea, based on
the prototype system, was proposed for applying the subnetwork method to earthquake monitoring (Wu et al., 1999).
Using the subnetwork concept and M L10 , a quick magnitude
determination method (Wu et al
