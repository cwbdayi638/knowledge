ABSTRACT
Two earthquakes, M w 8.1 in 2007 and M w 7.1 in 2010, hit the
western province of the Solomon Islands and caused extensive
damage, which motivated us to establish a temporary seismic
network around the rupture zones of these earthquakes. With
the available continuous seismic data recorded from eight seismic stations, we cross correlate the vertical component of ambient-noise records and calculate Rayleigh-wave group velocity
dispersion curves for interstation pairs. A genetic algorithm is
adopted to fit the averaged dispersion curve and invert a 1D
crustal velocity model, which constitutes two layers (upper and
lower crust) and a half-space (uppermost mantle). The resulting thickness values for the upper and lower crust are 6.9 and
13.5 km, respectively. The shear-wave velocities (V S ) of the
upper crust, lower crust, and uppermost mantle are 2.62, 3.54,
and 4:10 km=s with V P =V S ratios of 1.745, 1.749, and 1.766,
respectively. The differences between the predicted and observed travel times show that our 1D model (WSOLOCrust)
has average 0.85- and 0.16-s improvements in travel-time
residuals compared with the global iasp91 and local CRUST
1.0 models, respectively. This layered crustal velocity model
for the western Solomon Islands can be further used as a
referenced velocity model to locate earthquake and tremor
sources as well as to perform 3D seismic tomography in this
region.

Electronic Supplement: Figures showing the misfit of inversion
process and the comparison between observed and synthetics
and the location of experiments in previous studies and tables
listing information about the seismic network, parameters of
the genetic algorithm (GA), information of earthquakes used
in this study, and results obtained from different 1D
models.

INTRODUCTION
The Solomon Islands is located in the southwestern part of the
Pacific Ocean. Several tectonic plates, including the Pacific,
Australian, and Woodlark plates, subduct beneath the Solomon arc, forming an active subduction zone (Fig. 1). In 2007,
an M w 8.1 earthquake occurred in the western Solomon Islands and ruptured across the Pacific–Australian–Woodlark
triple junction (Taylor et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Miyagi
et al., 2009). This event generated a hazardous tsunami with a
maximum wave height of 12 m that hit the western province of
the Solomon Islands, which resulted in 52 deaths and thousands homeless (Fisher et al., 2007; Fritz and Kalligeris,
2008). About 3 yrs later in 2010, a relatively
