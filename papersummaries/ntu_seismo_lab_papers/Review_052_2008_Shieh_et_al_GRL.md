A comparison of t c and t max
for magnitude estimation in earthquake
p
early warning
Jang-Tian Shieh,1 Yih-Min Wu,1 and Richard M. Allen2
Received 11 August 2008; revised 9 September 2008; accepted 15 September 2008; published 16 October 2008.

[1] We determined the t c and t max
parameters from the
p
K-NET strong motion records of 16 earthquakes in Japan
with moment magnitude (Mw) ranging from 6.0 to 8.3. A
0.075 Hz high-pass Butterworth filter was applied for
determination of t c based on our previous studies. It was
found that different pole selections of the Butterworth filter
lead to different uncertainty in magnitude determination.
Our results show that using two poles in the filters results in
the best magnitude estimates, i.e., minimized the standard
deviation in magnitude determination in comparison to Mw
using t c. The t max
parameters (Allen and Kanamori, 2003)
p
were also determined with the same dataset using the
Wurman et al. (2007) procedure. It was found that t max
p
values obtained from this dataset, and using the Wurman
procedure, had a larger uncertainty. However, when a
0.075 Hz high-pass Butterworth filter with five poles was
added, the uncertainty in t max
p -derived magnitude estimates
decreased minimizing the standard deviation in magnitude
determination using t max
p . This difference in the behavior of
can be used to further reduce the uncertainty in
t c and t max
p
rapid magnitude determination for earthquake early
warning. When the magnitude estimations from t c and
of each event are averaged to provide a new magnitude
t max
p
estimate, the standard deviation in magnitude estimates is
reduced further to 0.27 magnitude units. Citation: Shieh,

1. Introduction
[2] A central component of earthquake early-warning
(EEW) systems is the determination of the magnitude and
location of an earthquake as soon as possible and before
destructive energy arrives. Nakamura [1988] first introduced the concept of using the frequency content of the
initial few seconds of P-wave arrivals. He observed that
larger events cause initial ground motion with longer
periods than smaller events. Average ground motion period
are two
t c and dominant ground motion period t max
p
important parameters frequently used to estimate the
magnitude in EEW [e.g., Allen and Kanamori, 2003;
Kanamori, 2005; Olson and Allen, 2005; Wu and
Kanamori, 2005a, 2008a, 2008b; Wu et al., 2007; Wurman
et al., 2007; Olivieri et al., 2008]. One measure of P-wave

frequency content is t c which uses the first 3 seconds of
P-wave data. The results of Wu and Kanamori [2005a,
2005b, 2008a, 2008b] and Wu et al. [2006, 2007] show a
good relationship between t c and Mw determined from
data
