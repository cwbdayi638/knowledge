INTRODUCTION
The Beijing capital region (36°N–42°N, 113.5°E–120°E) is
located in northern China and includes Beijing City, Tianjin
City, and Hebei Province. This region of critical economic
and cultural importance is threatened by large earthquakes.
Historical earthquake records show that this region has been
struck by many strong-to-great earthquakes (see Figure 1), with
magnitudes up to M 8 (the 1679 Sanhe-Pinggu earthquake). In
the 20th century, the 1976 M 7.8 Tangshan earthquake caused
more than 240,000 fatalities and uncountable economic losses.
Developing an earthquake early warning system (EEWS)
in this region is therefore of great importance and necessity.
This necessity was dramatically highlighted by the disastrous
Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. After the Wenchuan earthquake, a news media report that Japanese seismologists could
“predict” an earthquake several seconds before its occurrence
caused a lot of discussion in China. This was actually a misunderstanding of the EEWS performance during the IwateMiyagi Nairiku earthquake on 14 June 2008, about one month
after the Wenchuan earthquake, but the importance of EEWS
in earthquake disaster mitigation has become more and more
evident. Accordingly, the China Earthquake Administration
(CEA) was motivated to configure a nationwide EEWS.
EEW systems have recently been developed in many countries and regions, such as Japan (Nakamura 1988, 1996, 2004;
Horiuchi et al. 2005; Nakamura and Saita 2007; Hoshiba et
al. 2008; Brown et al. 2009; Kamigaichi et al. 2009), southern
California (Allen and Kanamori 2003; Wu et al. 2007; Böse
et al. 2008; Allen, Brown et al. 2009; Böse et al. 2009; Cua
et al. 2009; Köhler et al. 2009), Mexico (Espinosa-Aranda et
al. 1995; Goltz and Flores 1997; Espinosa-Aranda et al. 2009;
Suárez et al. 2009), Taiwan (Wu and Teng 2002; Hsiao et al.
2009), Turkey (Erdik et al. 2003; Alcik et al. 2009; Fleming et
al. 2009), Romania (Wenzel et al. 1999; Ionescu et al. 2007),
and Italy (Zollo et al. 2006; Weber et al. 2007; Olivieri et al.
2008; Zollo et al. 2009). Studies of the properties of seismic

waves and strong ground motion have provided scientific
grounds for the implementation of EEWS (Nakamura 1988;
Espinosa-Aranda et al. 1995; Allen and Kanamori 2003;
Kamigaichi 2004; Kanamori 2005; Wu and Kanamori 2005a,
