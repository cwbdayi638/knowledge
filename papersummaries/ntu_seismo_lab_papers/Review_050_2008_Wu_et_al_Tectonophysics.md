We investigate the variations in seismicity pattern in the Taiwan region before the 2003 Chengkung, Taiwan,
earthquake (Mw = 6.8) by calculating the standard normal deviate of the Z-values and b-values from
the Gutenberg–Richter relation. The Mogi donut-shaped variations in the seismicity can be identiﬁed in the
Z-value map surrounding the Chengkung earthquake source region. Noticeable decreases in the b-values
have also been found around the mainshock region before the Chengkung event. The relatively lowseismicity rate and the decrease in the b-values may be the precursory phenomena associated with the
quiescence in overall seismicity and the activation of moderate-sized events occurred around the mainshock
region before the Chengkung event.

1. Introduction
Taiwan is located on the western Circum-Paciﬁc seismic belt. Off
the east coast, the Philippine Sea plate plunges northward under the
Eurasian plate along the Ryukyu trench, whereas the Eurasian plate
subducts eastward beneath the Philippine Sea plate off the southern
tip of the island of Taiwan (Tsai et al., 1977; Wu, 1978). Tectonically,
most of the Taiwan region is under NW–SE compression with a convergence rate of about 8 cm/year (Yu et al., 1997). The complex pattern
in which these two plates interact has resulted in many highly
complicated regional geological features and active seismicity. Fig. 1
shows the tectonic environment in the region and the distribution of
the earthquakes of M ≥ 3.0 between 1991 and 2006.
Based on the tectonics and seismic characteristics, the Taiwan
region can be classiﬁed into four different seismogenic zones (Wu and
Chen, 2007): (A) Western Seismic Zone: located within the Eurasia
Plate (Fig. 1). Most of the earthquakes in this zone can be associated
with active faults; (B) Southwestern Seismic Zone: located mainly in
the South China Sea block of the Eurasian Plate. In terms of seismic
activity, this is the least active zone among the four; (C) Northeastern
Seismic Zone: associated with the
