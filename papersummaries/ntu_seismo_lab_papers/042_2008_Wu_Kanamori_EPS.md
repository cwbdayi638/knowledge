In view of the remarkable success of the Japan Meteorological Agency earthquake early warning system
(developed jointly with the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention) during the
2007 Noto Hanto earthquake, we explore the use of an on-site early warning method with the hope of eventually
enhancing the existing system for more robust and faster warning. We determined two early warning parameters
τc and Pd using the K-NET and KiK-net data for the 2007 Noto Hanto earthquake as well as 20 large earthquakes
in Japan. An extended method suggests a possibility of using the initial displacement amplitude data for faster
warning. For the two nearby sites at the epicentral distances of 7 and 19 km of the 2007 Noto Hanto earthquake,
an early warning can be ideally issued at 2.27 and 5.46 s, respectively, before the peak ground motion velocity
occurs at the site.
Key words: Earthquake early warning, magnitude, seismic hazard mitigation, P-waves.

Introduction

Several earthquake early warning methods have been recently developed, and some of them have been already implemented either experimentally or for actual operation.
In particular, the systems developed at the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention
(NIED) (Horiuchi et al., 2005) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) (Tsukada et al., 2004) were integrated
in June, 2005. JMA started official distribution of early
warning information to a limited number of organizations
in August, 2006, and plans to distribute it to the public in
the fall of 2007. This system includes on-site warning capability using the amplitude and the temporal variation of
acceleration at a single station. The system was successfully activated during the 2007 Noto Hanto (Peninsula) and
the 2007 Niigata Chuetsu-Oki earthquakes, and provided
accurate information regarding the source location, magnitude and intensity at about 3.8 s after the arrival of P wave
at nearby stations. This information reached the sites further than about 30 km from the epicenter as “early” warning (i.e., information arrived before shaking started at the
site). This is a remarkable performance of the system for inland (or close to the shore) damaging earthquakes and gave
promise of an early warning system as a practical means for
earthquake damage mitigation. Although the warning did
not reach close-in sites in time (i.e., the information arrived
after shaking began) within about 30 km from the epicenter where such warnings are mos
