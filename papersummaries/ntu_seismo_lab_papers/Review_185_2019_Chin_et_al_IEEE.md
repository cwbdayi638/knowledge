Abstract— Earthquake early warning system uses high-speed
computer network to transmit earthquake information to population center ahead of the arrival of destructive earthquake
waves. This short (10 s of seconds) lead time will allow emergency
responses such as turning off gas pipeline valves to be activated to
mitigate potential disaster and casualties. However, the excessive
false alarm rate of such a system imposes heavy cost in terms
of loss of services, undue panics, and diminishing credibility of
such a warning system. At the current, the decision algorithm
to issue an early warning of the onset of an earthquake is
often based on empirically chosen features and heuristically set
thresholds and suffers from excessive false alarm rate. In this
paper, we experimented with three advanced machine learning
algorithms, namely, K -nearest neighbor (KNN), classification
tree, and support vector machine (SVM) and compared their
performance against a traditional criterion-based method. Using
the seismic data collected by an experimental strong motion
detection network in Taiwan for these experiments, we observed
that the machine learning algorithms exhibit higher detection
accuracy with much reduced false alarm rate.
Index Terms— Detection accuracy, earthquake detection,
machine learning.

I. I NTRODUCTION
N THE recent years, earthquakes occurred much more
frequently around the circum-Pacific seismic belt and usually caused severe casualties. In 2011, the 311 Tōhoku earthquake in Japan caused 15 891 deaths and severe damages for
the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In 1999, more
than 2415 deaths and 11 305 severely wounded have been
confirmed in the 921 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan. Since
earthquake has become a serious threat to human life and
property, a significant research effort has been devoted in
