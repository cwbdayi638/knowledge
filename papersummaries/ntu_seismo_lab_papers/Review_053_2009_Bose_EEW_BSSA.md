Short Note
A New Trigger Criterion for Improved Real-Time Performance of Onsite
Earthquake Early Warning in Southern California

Abstract

We have implemented and tested an algorithm for onsite earthquake
early warning (EEW) in California using the infrastructure of the Southern California
Seismic Network (SCSN). The algorithm relies on two parameters derived from the
initial 3 sec of P waveform data at a single seismic sensor: period parameter τ c and
high-pass filtered displacement amplitude Pd . Previous studies have determined empirical relationships between τ c and the moment magnitude Mw of an earthquake, and
between Pd and the peak ground velocity (PGV) at the site of observation. In 2007,
seven local earthquakes in southern California with 4:0 ≤ ML ≤ 4:7 have triggered
the calculation of Mw and PGV by the EEW algorithm. While the mean values of estimated parameters were in the expected range, the scatter was large, in particular for
the smallest events. During the same time period the EEW algorithm produced a large
number of false triggers due to low trigger thresholds. To improve the real-time performance of the onsite approach, we have developed a new trigger criterion that is
based on combinations of observed τ c and Pd values. This new criterion removes
97% of previous false triggers and leads to a significant reduction of the scatter in
magnitude estimates for small earthquakes.

Introduction
Earthquake early warning (EEW) systems make use of
differences between the propagation speed of seismic and
electromagnetic waves and issue warnings, if necessary, to
potential users before strong shaking at the user sites occurs.
The maximal warning time of an EEW system is generally
defined as the time span between the P-wave detection at the
first triggered EEW sensor and the arrival of high-amplitude S
or surface waves at the user site. As these time periods usually are extremely short, EEW systems must recognize the
severity of expected ground motions within a few seconds.
Based on this information, suitable actions for the damage
reduction can be triggered and executed (Harben, 1991;
Goltz, 2002).
EEW systems face two major challenges: (1) they have
to be highly reliable, which means that both missed and false
alerts need to be avoided; (2) the warning times should be as
large as possible. About six EEW systems are presently in
operation or in testing: in Japan (Nakamura, 1988; Kamigaichi, 2004; Horiuchi et al., 2005; Tsukada et al., 2007), in
Taiwan (Wu and Teng, 2002; Wu and Kanamori 2005a,b),
in California (Allen and Kanamori, 2003; Kanamori, 2005;
Allen, 2007; Cua and Heaton, 2007; Wu et al., 2007; Wurman et al., 2007), in Mexico (Espinosa-Aranda et al., 1995),
in Romania (Wenzel et al., 1999; Böse et al., 2007), and in

Turkey (Erdik et al., 20
