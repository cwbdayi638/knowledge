Abstract Captured CO2 could be deliberately injected
into the ocean at great depth, where most of it would
remain isolated from the atmosphere for centuries. CO2 can
be transported via pipeline or ship for release in the ocean
or on the sea floor. In Taiwan, CO2 release is preliminarily
projected from 2010 to 2030 in an average amount of
6.957 Gt within this duration. If deep sea sequestration for
CO2 can be the possible option in Taiwan, it seems to exists
possible potential area delimited between 122.0°E to
122.5°E and 21.8°N to 22.3°N for CO2 sequestration on
account of its isolated and flat topography. Apparently, the
area to the southeast of Taiwan is found to reach a depth
deeper than -3,000 m and can be taken as a testing area
for pilot studies. This study searches the area using the
contours from the depth of -4,554 to -5,500 m with 1-m
interval; the area, topographic volume, maximum mean
height (volume/area), and ocean volume are reported. If the
emission rate is kept constantly, for 20-year storage it
needs 3 m of thickness reaching the sea ridge at the depth
-4,554 m using top-down style; for 100 years of storage it
needs 12 m. On the other hand, if it accounts for the bottom
the sea floor is taken as the reference and the accumulated
CO2 is stored from the depth at -4,900 m using bottom-up
style, it requires about 37 m for the 20-year storage and
61 m for one decade.

1 Introduction
Direct ocean injection of CO2 is one of several approaches
under consideration to sequester carbon dioxide in order to
stabilize increased atmospheric CO2. A potential CO2
storage option is to inject captured CO2 directly into the
deep ocean at depths deeper than -1,000 m or more, where
most of CO2 would be isolated from the atmosphere for
centuries. This can be achieved by transporting CO2 via
pipelines or ships to an ocean storage site, where CO2 is
injected into the water column of the ocean or at the sea
floor. At typical pressures and temperatures, CO2 exists as
gas in the ocean at a depth of approximately -500 m and
as a liquid below that depth. Between depths of about 500 and -2,700 m, liquid CO2 is lighter than sea water
(IPCC 2005). Deeper than -3,000 m, liquid CO2 is denser
than sea water. The buoyancy of CO2 released into the
ocean determines whether released CO2 rises or falls in the
ocean column. In the gas phase, CO2 is lighter than sea
water and rises. In the liquid p
