Abstract
The Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan deployed 62 borehole seismic stations equipped
with accelerometers and broadband seismometers by the end of 2018. Currently, a large
number of earthquake records has been accumulated because of the high seismicity rate
of Taiwan. These records can be used to detect microseismicity because the background
seismic noise level is lower at downhole stations than surface stations. However, the magnitudes of the waveforms recorded by the downhole stations are lower than those of
surface stations because of near-surface site effects. In Taiwan, local magnitude (ML )
determinations use an attenuation function derived from surface stations, and ML will be
underestimated if this attenuation function is used for downhole stations. Records of
14,653 earthquakes were used to determine site amplifications corresponding to site corrections of the surface to downhole. For all available earthquake–station pairs, a total of
5470 amplification factors satisfied condition of the incident angle less than 35°, which are
used for further discussion in this work. The results reveal that amplification factors ranging from 1.11 to 6.07 can be used to describe site effects. These amplification factors are
strongly correlated with V S30 (average shear-wave velocity for the top 30 m of strata). The
amplification factor was used to revise station M L for downhole accelerometer (denoted
MLB ), and revised MLB (MLBNEW ) was compared with M L from the surface accelerometer
(denoted M LS ). Results show that MLBNEW and M LS are similar. Using the derived site corrections of surface to downhole, the downhole seismograms can be used to directly determine ML , especially for the borehole broadband waveforms, enhancing detection
capabilities for microearthquakes and improving the Taiwanese earthquake catalog.

Introduction
The local magnitude (M L ) scale introduced by Richter (1935) is
widely used to report earthquake magnitude not only for rapid
earthquake reporting (Kanamori, 1983) but also for estimating
the strength of ground shaking in frequency ranges relevant to
engineering applications (Kanamori and Jennings, 1978). M L is
originally defined for southern California based on earthquake
recordings of the Wood–Anderson torsion seismograph.
The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) of Taiwan adopted the
empirical attenuation function proposed by Shin (1993) for
M L calculations using recordings of the three-component
short-period digital seismographs at surface stations of the
CWB Seismic Network (CWBSN). Since 2012, the CWBSN
has been upgraded with 24-bit analog-to-digital converters
and on-site Global Positioning System timing system; this network is called CWBSN24. Guan et al. (2020) derived new
empirical attenuation functions based on seismic records from
CWBSN24, improving the reliabilit
