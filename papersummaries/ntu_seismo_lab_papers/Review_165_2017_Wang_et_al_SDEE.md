Sanchiao fault in Taipei

Many earthquake empirical models were developed based on the statistics in the past. However, it is commonly
seen that a non-local model was applied to a local study without any adjustment. In this paper, a new algorithm
using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to adjust a non-local model for local applications was presented,
including a case study assessing the probability of major earthquake occurrences in Taipei. Speciﬁcally,
considering the fault length of 36 km and slip rate of 2 mm/yr, it suggests the Sanchiao (or Shanchiao) fault
could induce a major earthquake with magnitude Mw 7.14 ± 0.17, based on a non-local model integrated with
limited local data using the MLE algorithms.

1. Introduction
Given our imperfect understandings and natural randomness, many
earthquake empirical models were developed with earthquake statistics
of the past [1–6]. For example, Wu and Kanamori proposed a relationship between PD3 and PGV (maximum ground displacement in the ﬁrst
three seconds and peak ground velocity) that became a key empirical
relationship to on-site earthquake early warning [1]. Similarly, several
empirical models between earthquake magnitude and diﬀerent fault
characteristics (e.g., fault length) were developed [2,3], which are
useful to earthquake potential assessment for a mapped fault [7,35].
Moreover, ground motion prediction equations that are essential to
seismic hazard analysis are usually an empirical model [4–6]. For
instance, Lin et al. developed a series of local ground motion models
based on the data in Taiwan [6], which were essential to seismic hazard
assessments for the region [8].
From the examples above, we can see that earthquake empirical
models play an important role in earthquake study, considering that
earthquake analytical models are still diﬃcult to be reliably developed
(mainly owing to nature randomness and our imperfect understanding).
However, from model development to application, the following
question is often asked and encountered: Are non-local empirical
models suitable for local applications?
A possible solution to this epistemic uncertainty is to develop a local
empirical model from scratch, then applying it to any local applications.
However, for an earthquake study, the data are usually very limited
