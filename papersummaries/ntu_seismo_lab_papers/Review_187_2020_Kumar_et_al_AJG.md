Abstract
Development of earthquake early warning system (EEWS) is in advanced stage in different parts of the world including India.
The success of EEWS for mitigating seismic risk and saving human lives has been well documented in Mexico, Japan, and
Taiwan, where the alert is issued to the public. Taking advantage of the recorded ground motion data from the network of Institute
of Seismological Research (ISR), India, with magnitude range 3.0–5.2, we investigated correlations between various ground
motion parameters like peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), peak ground displacement (PGD), Pa,
Pv, Pd, and τc.Three- to 5-s time windows are considered to measure Pa, Pv, Pd, and τc from the vertical component of the
waveforms. Linear regression analysis is performed at various time steps (3- to 5-s time interval). The results show that
considering 4- and 5-s windows exhibits good relationships compared with the 3-s window, which shows more scattering.
These empirical relationships using τc and M as well as Pd and M are very helpful in determining the earthquake magnitude
and subsequently taking steps toward risk assessment.

Introduction
The success of earthquake early warning (EEW) for mitigating
seismic risk and saving human lives has been well documented
in Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, and other parts of the World. EEW is
a process in which warning is issued before the arrival of strong
ground shaking. Mexico and Japan are providing EEW alerts to
the public (Allen et al. 2009; Kamigaichi et al. 2009; Wu et al.
2007). The EEW system of Mexico utilizes peak ground motion
(PGM), to issue 60 s or more warning to the public in Mexico
City (around 300 km away) from earthquake occurring near the

Guerrero gap subduction zone (Anderson et al. 1995; EspinosaAranda et al. 1995). Japan uses more than 4500 instruments for
real-time recording of earthquakes as well as for providing a
warning (Hoshiba et al. 2008). Depending upon the location of
occurrence of the earthquake, the warning time in Japan may
range from a few seconds to 40 s. Ta
