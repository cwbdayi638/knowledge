2024 Mw 7.4 Hualien Event

ABSTRACT
On 2 April 2024, a major earthquake with a moment magnitude (Mw ) of 7.4 struck the
Hualien area of eastern Taiwan. Because of a significant directivity effect, with the rupture
propagating from the south-southwest to the north-northeast direction, the earthquake
caused damage, including in the Taipei metropolitan area, which is located approximately
120 km north of the epicenter. The Central Weather Administration (CWA) earthquake
early warning (EEW) system issued two Public Warning Service alerts at 8 and 14 s after
the earthquake’s origin. However, the system underestimated both the earthquake magnitude and ground-motion intensity in northern Taiwan, excluding the densely populated
Taipei metropolitan area from the alerts. In contrast, the high-density P-Alert network,
maintained by National Taiwan University, offered onsite EEW, delivering at least 3 s
of lead time for areas near the epicenter and compensating for the missed warnings in
the Taipei metropolitan area. The P-Alert network also generated detailed real-time shakemaps within 2.5 min, significantly aiding disaster response efforts and identifying the rupture’s directivity. Finally, testing of the ShakingAlarm demonstrated its effectiveness in
filling the gap left by the CWA regional EEW system, providing an additional warning
for the Taipei metropolitan area. This research demonstrates the critical role of the PAlert network in addressing the challenges posed by the earthquake’s directivity effect
and enhancing early warning effectiveness.

KEY POINTS

• This study addresses early warning challenges from the
directivity effect of the 0403 Hualien earthquake.

• The P-Alert network provided onsite and ground-motion
model-based warnings, compensating for missed alerts.

• A high-density seismic network could improve resource
allocation and earthquake resilience.

INTRODUCTION
The earthquake early warning (EEW) system is critical for mitigating earthquake-related damage. By monitoring the initial
seismic waves in real time, the system can quickly estimate
the earthquake information and issue timely alerts to areas
likely to be affected. This provides the public with valuable
time to evacuate and take protective action, thereby significantly mitigating disaster-related losses. Taiwan is one of
the leading countries in the world in implementing and operating a formal EEW system that issues public alerts (Wu et al.,
2021). Located at the junction of the Eurasian plate (EP) and
the Philippine Sea plate (PSP), the geological structures of
