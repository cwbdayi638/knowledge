Abstract—We use preseismic, coseismic, and postseismic GPS data of the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake to infer
spatio-temporal variation of fault slip and frictional behavior on the Chelungpu fault. The geodetic data shows
that coseismic slip during the Chi-Chi earthquake occurred within a patch that was locked in the period
preceding the earthquake, and that afterslip occurred dominantly downdip from the ruptured area. To first-order,
the observed pattern and the temporal evolution of afterslip is consistent with models of the seismic cycle based
on rate-and-state friction. Comparison with the distribution of temperature on the fault derived from thermokinematic modeling shows that aseismic slip becomes dominant where temperature is estimated to exceed 200°
at depth. This inference is consistent with the temperature induced transition from velocity-weakening to
velocity-strengthening friction that is observed in laboratory experiments on quartzo-feldspathic rocks. The time
evolution of afterslip is consistent with afterslip being governed by velocity-strengthening frictional sliding. The
dependency of friction, l, on the sliding velocity, V, is estimated to be ol=o ln V ¼ 8  103 : We report an
azimuthal difference of about 10–20° between preseismic and postseismic GPS velocities, which we interpret to
reflect the very low shear stress on the creeping portion of the décollement beneath the Central Range, of the
order of 1–3 MPa, implying a very low friction of about 0.01. This study highlights the importance of
temperature and pore pressure in determining fault frictional sliding.
Key words: The Chi-Chi earthquake, fault friction, fault rheology, stress, fault slip distribution.

1. Introduction
Fault slip occurs as steady aseismic creep or as recurring transient slip, the latter of
which might be seismic or aseismic. This process leads to an alternation between long
periods of slow elastic strain accumulation, the interseismic period, and short periods of
strain release by transient slip events and large earthquakes. An unanswered first-order
