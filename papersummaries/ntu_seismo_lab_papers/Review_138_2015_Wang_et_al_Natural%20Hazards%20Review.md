Abstract: The region around Taiwan is known for high seismicity. Under the circumstances, seismic hazard assessments and proper
earthquake-resistant designs are essential to the region. From a well-studied earthquake catalog, this paper presents the statistics of major
earthquakes (i.e., moment magnitude Mw ≥ 5.5 and distance ≤ 200 km) around the most important city in Taiwan (i.e., Taipei). The analysis
shows that the mean annual rate of the major earthquakes is 2.79 around the city, with mean magnitude and SD equal to M w 6.12 and 0.68,
respectively, and mean source-to-site distance and SD equal to 129 and 39 km, respectively. With the earthquake statistics and local ground
motion models, a seismic hazard assessment was conducted with Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). The analysis shows the mean rate for
peak ground acceleration ≥ 0.23g (where g is gravitational acceleration) should be around 0.013 per year, indicating that the current design
peak ground acceleration in Taipei. From this paper, the current seismic design in Taipei might not be as conservative as expected, and a
review and revision could be needed for assuring the city’s seismic safety against high seismicity in the region. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)NH

Introduction
The region around Taiwan is known for high seismicity. On average, around the region there are about 2,000 earthquakes every year
and catastrophic events, such as the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake,
could recur in decades. However, earthquake prediction nowadays
is still controversial and unsuccessful (Geller et al. 1997), so that
the alternatives such as earthquake early warning and seismic hazard analysis are considered more practical to earthquake hazard
mitigation (e.g., Campbell et al. 2002; Cheng et al. 2007; Wu
and Kanamori 2008; Hsiao et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2012b).
Taipei, the most important city in Taiwan, is therefore under
an earthquake threat. For the seismic safety of the city, a few studies
focusing on investigating earthquake potentials and seismic hazards were reported. For example, by examining the sediments
of the Taipei basin, Huang et al. (2007) considered that a few large
earthquakes should have occurred in the past 10,000 years (or in the
Holocene). In addition, Wang et al. (2013) conducted a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) for the city, including seismic
hazard deaggregation and suggestions of earthquake time histories
for seismic design.
From a different perspective, the key scope of this paper is
to review the major earthquakes around Taipei (i.e., moment
magnitude M w ≥ 5.5
