This study develops a probabilistic approach for examining site-speciﬁc seismic hazards using data
from 438 Mw Z 5.5 earthquakes and attenuation relationships local to the region around Taiwan. These
are combined to generate semi-observed peak ground accelerations, in a form which can be modeled by
a double-lognormal distribution. This model, which satisﬁes statistical goodness-of-ﬁt, provides the
relationship between the exceedance probability and a given ground motion level. The study includes
site-speciﬁc seismic hazard analysis for four nuclear power plant sites in Taiwan. The results show that
the seismic hazards at the four sites are not the same. While no seismic hazard analysis is without
challenge, a troublesome trend appears that many applications of decision making are being inﬂuenced
by the complexity of the calculation, instead of how well the fundamentals of the analysis are
understood and can be veriﬁed. The study provides an analysis which is not overly complicated, is in
good agreement with an empirical control, and offers transparency, traceability, and veriﬁability.

1. Introduction
The region around Taiwan is known for high seismic risk
owing to its unique tectonic setting. Catastrophic earthquakes,
such as the Chi–Chi earthquake in 1999, have pounded the island
and caused extensive damage. In preparing a plan for earthquake
hazard mitigation, the question which needs to be answered is
not ‘‘whether’’ future catastrophic events will occur, but rather
‘‘when’’, ‘‘where’’ and ‘‘how large’’ the event will be. Wang et al.
[1] studied the distribution of annual maximum earthquakes
since the year 1900 and suggested a ﬁve percent probability for
a catastrophic earthquake event striking Central Taiwan within
the next 50 years.
Geoscientists and civil engineers have spent countless time
and effort studying earthquake engineering and hazard mitigation
for the study region. Taiwan’s Central Geological Survey, have
been investigating active faults in Taiwan and publishing these
