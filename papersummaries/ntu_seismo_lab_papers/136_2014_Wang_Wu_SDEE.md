From recent lessons, it is evident that earthquake prediction is immature and impractical as of now.
Under the circumstances, seismic hazard analysis is considered a more practical approach for earthquake
hazard mitigation, by estimating the annual rate of earthquake ground motions (or seismic hazard)
based on seismicity and other geological evidences. Like other earthquake studies for the high-seismicity
region around Taiwan, this study aims to conduct a new seismic hazard assessment for the region using
the well-established FOSM (ﬁrst-order second-moment) algorithm, on the record of 55,000 earthquakes
observed in the past 110 years. The new seismic hazard analysis from a different perspective shows that
the annual rate for earthquake-induced PGA to exceed the current design value (i.e., 0.23g) in two major
cities in Taiwan should be relatively low, with it no greater than 0.0006 per year. Besides, the FOSM
estimates were found very close to those with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), mainly because the
skewness of the three random variables (i.e., earthquake magnitude, location, and model error)
considered in the probabilistic analysis is not very large.

1. Introduction
Since it is challenging to predict an earthquake’s magnitude,
location and time, seismic hazard analysis is considered a more
practical engineering solution for earthquake hazard mitigation
[1]. But before introducing the analysis, it is worth clarifying the
deﬁnition of seismic hazard in the ﬁrst place: Rather than casualty
or economic loss induced by earthquakes, seismic hazard refers to
the annual rate of earthquake ground motions, such as an estimate
of PGA 40.1g¼ 0.01 per year. In other words, seismic hazard
analysis aims to develop a site-speciﬁc earthquake-resistant
design based on earthquake data (e.g., seismicity) around a site.
Nowadays, Deterministic Seismic Hazard Analysis (DSHA) and
Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA) are the two representative approaches, with many case studies reported in the last
few decades [2–5]. On the other hand, new seismic hazard
assessments were also reported recently [6–8]. For example, based
on earthquake intensity data in the last 500 years, Liu et al. [6]
quantiﬁed seismic hazards in North China from a different perspective than the conve
