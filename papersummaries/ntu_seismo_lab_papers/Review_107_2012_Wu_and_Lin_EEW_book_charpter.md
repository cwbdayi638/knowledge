Abstract
The earthquake early warning (EEW) research group at the National Taiwan
University (NTU) and one technology company have been developing a Micro
Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) type of accelerometer (the “Palert” EEW
sensor) specifically designed for EEW purpose. In addition to the physical properties of the MEMS accelerometer, the main advantage of the MEMS accelerometer
comparing to the other seismometers is that it is a relatively very low-cost seismic
sensor. We present the performances of the Palert EEW network located at the
Hualien region during a two-month experiment. The results of the Hualien Palert
network encourage the further implementations for the MEMS-type of seismometer in the EEW application.

Introduction
Taiwan has been constantly threatened by large, devastating earthquakes as the
consequence of the persistent collision between the Philippine Sea Plate and Eurasian Plate. For Taiwan, the development of earthquake early warning system was
first motivated by the Hualien offshore earthquake (Mw = 7.8) in November 15,
1986, which caused severe damage in the metropolitan Taipei of about 120 km
away from the epicenter. If an EEW system in the Hualien area can provide an
earthquake warning within 20 seconds (i.e. crustal shear-wave travelling time over
a distance of 120 km) after the occurrence of the Hualien earthquake, a timely
warning can be feasible for the highly populated Taipei area. Since then Taiwan
has been developing EEW system and become one of leading countries on EEW
practices.
