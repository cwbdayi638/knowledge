A Comprehensive Relocation of Earthquakes
in Taiwan from 1991 to 2005
by Yih-Min Wu, Chien-Hsin Chang, Li Zhao, Ta-Liang Teng,* and Mamoru Nakamura

Abstract

We have carried out a comprehensive relocation of a total of 267,210
earthquakes in Taiwan that occurred during the past 15 yr. We based our relocation
process on the earthquake catalog of the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau Seismic
Network (CWBSN) and made improvements in three aspects. First, we incorporated
a large dataset of the S-P times from 680 Taiwan Strong-Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) stations distributed throughout the island of Taiwan to improve the
coverage of earthquakes on the island. Secondly, we added 18 Japan Meteorological
Agency (JMA) stations in the southern Ryukyu Island chain to enhance the station
coverage for eastern offshore events, especially around the subduction zone northeast
of Taiwan. Thirdly, we adopted 3D V P and V P =V S models in predicting the travel
times of P and S waves. The effectiveness of these improvements in earthquake relocation can be seen in three aspects: (1) the reduction in the residuals of P-wave
arrival times and S-P times, (2) a better understanding of the attenuation relationship
between the peak-ground acceleration and epicentral distance, and (3) the geologically
meaningful patterns of station corrections to P-wave arrival times and S-P times.

Introduction
Taiwan is one of the most seismically active regions in
the world. It is situated in the western portion of the Pacific
Rim seismic belt. Along the Ryukyu trench east of the island
of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea plate subducts northward
under the Eurasian plate. Off the southern tip of the island,
the South China Sea subplate, part of the Eurasian plate, subducts eastward under the Philippine Sea plate (Tsai et al.,
1977). Figure 1 is a schematic diagram showing the major
geologic settings in the region. On the southeast side of
Taiwan, the Longitudinal Valley, the suture zone of Eurasian
and Philippine Sea plates, separates the region into two major
tectonic provinces. The eastern side consists of the Coastal
Range and several volcanic islands, and it is the leading edge
of the Philippine Sea plate. The western province is associated with the Eurasian continental shelf (Ho, 1999), and
can be classified into four north-northeast–south-southwest
trending tectonic belts. They are, from west to east, the
Coastal Plain, the Western Foothills, the Hsuehshan Range,
and the Central Range (Fig. 1).
As a result of the regional tectonic movements, most of
Taiwan is under a northwest–southeast compression with a
