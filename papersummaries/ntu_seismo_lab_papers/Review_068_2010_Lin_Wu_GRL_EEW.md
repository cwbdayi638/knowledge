Magnitude determination using strong ground‐
motion attenuation in earthquake early warning
Ting‐Li Lin1 and Yih‐Min Wu1
Received 13 January 2010; revised 23 February 2010; accepted 8 March 2010; published 7 April 2010.

[1] We use 1661 strong‐motion accelerograms with peak
ground acceleration (PGA) larger than 80 Gal (1 Gal =
1.0 cm/s2) from 77 earthquakes recorded by the Taiwan
Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) stations
to derive a strong‐motion attenuation relationship. This
relationship can be used to dynamically define a “M pga
magnitude” for earthquakes using earthquake locations
determined by earthquake early warning process. The
M pga magnitude using this strong‐motion attenuation
relationship corresponds well with Mw given a sufficient
number of PGA readings. MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical
Systems) acceleration sensor could be widely used for ground
motion monitoring purposes. Thus, we propose that once a
large earthquake has begun, that we might be able to use
strong, near‐field (tens of kilometers) PGA values to quickly
estimate the earthquake’s magnitude, which would improve
earthquake early warning. Citation: Lin, T.‐L., and Y.‐M. Wu

1. Introduction
[2] When a large earthquake occurs, an earthquake early
warning (EEW) system can alert populations, sensitive
facilities such as nuclear reactors, gas pipelines, and public
transportation systems, ahead of the arrival of strong ground
shaking. The idea of an EEW system was proposed more
than one hundred years ago by Cooper [1868] for San
Francisco, California. An early warning leading time can be
a few seconds to a few tens of seconds depending on the
distance between the earthquake and the target warning
areas. Although this warning time window might seem
short, it can be critical, as even a few seconds are sufficient
to initiate pre‐programmed EEW emergency safety responses.
Therefore, EEW is a practical, effective approach to seismic
risk mitigation on a short time‐scale [Kanamori et al., 1997;
Teng et al., 1997; Wu and Teng, 2002; Allen and Kanamori,
2003; Kanamori, 2005] as compared to the longer time‐scale
earthquake prediction.
[3] The two most commonly used types of EEW are
regional and onsite warning systems. In regional EEW, the
ground shaking characteristics recorded by seismic sensors
closest to the earthquake rupture are used to predict strong
ground motions at more distant target areas. In onsite EEW,
the initial P‐wave motion at a given site is used to predict
the ground motions of the later S and surface waves (which
