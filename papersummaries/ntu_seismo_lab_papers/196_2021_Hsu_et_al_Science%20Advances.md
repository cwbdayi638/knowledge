INTRODUCTION

An unambiguous determination of the relationship between seismicity
and hydrological loading cycles could provide valuable insights for
improved regional hazard assessment. Previous studies have found
the seasonal modulation of seismicity to be influenced by water forcing in a variety of tectonic settings, including volcanic areas, plate
boundary zones, and plate interior regions that are subject to a wide
range of interseismic tectonic strain rates (10−3 to 1 strain/year) and
annual precipitation (0.3 to 3 m) (1–7). Often, seasonal modulation
of seismicity is only resolvable when performing annual stacks of all
events spanning a large number of years [e.g., (2)] or requires estimating Coulomb stress on representative fault planes and slip directions to document triggering [e.g., (4)]. However, statistical analyses
are often hampered by the limited number of events associated with
a low level of background seismicity, insufficient station coverage,
or short catalog durations. To establish statistical significance, these
analyses also require a careful consideration of catalog completeness
and event clustering (8–10).
Taiwan is located on the convergent boundary where the Philippine
Sea plate is colliding with the Eurasian plate at a rate of 85 to 90 mm/year
(11, 12). This region has both frequent damaging earthquakes, with
about one magnitude 6+ earthquake each year (13) and heavy
seasonal precipitation of more than 2000 mm/year on average (14).
The largest annual precipitation is close to 4 m, and the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall is uneven (Fig. 1A). About 70% of the
annual precipitation occurs from May to September and is primarily
