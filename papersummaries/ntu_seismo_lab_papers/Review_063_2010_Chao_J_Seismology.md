Abstract Coseismic deformation can be determined from strong-motion records of large earthquakes. Iwan et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am 75:
1225–1246, 1985) showed that baseline corrections
are often required to obtain reliable coseismic
deformation because baseline offsets lead to unrealistic permanent displacements. Boore (Bull Seismol Soc Am 91:1199–1211, 2001) demonstrated
that different choices of time points for baseline
correction can yield realistically looking displacements, but with variable amplitudes. The baseline
correction procedure of Wu and Wu (J Seismol
11:159–170, 2007) improved upon Iwan et al.
(Bull Seismol Soc Am 75:1225–1246, 1985) and
achieved stable results. However, their time points
for baseline correction were chosen by a recursive
process with an artificial criterion. In this study,
we follow the procedure of Wu and Wu (J Seismol 11:159–170, 2007) but use the ratio of energy

distribution in accelerograms as the criterion to
determine the time points of baseline correction
automatically, thus avoiding the manual choice
of time points and speeding up the estimation
of coseismic deformation. We use the 1999 ChiChi earthquake in central Taiwan and the 2003
Chengkung and 2006 Taitung earthquakes in eastern Taiwan to illustrate this new approach. Comparison between the results from this and previous
studies shows that our new procedure is suitable
for quick and reliable determination of coseismic
deformation from strong-motion records.

1 Introduction
Taiwan is located in a plate boundary region with
complex tectonic structures and high seismic activity. The Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan
monitors the regional earthquake activity with
a variety of instrumentation networks, among
which the Taiwan Strong-Motion Instrumentation
Program, in operation since 1991, provides a lot
of strong-motion records of large earthquakes.
These records contain important information for
the investigation of the coseismic deformation
and rupture processes of large earthquakes (Wu
et al. 2006a, b). In general, coseismic deformation
