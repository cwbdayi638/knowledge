Continuous seismic records near river channels can be used to quantify the energy induced by river
sediment transport. During the 2011 typhoon season, we deployed a seismic array along the Chishan River
in the mountain area of southern Taiwan, where there is strong variability in water discharge and high
sedimentation rates. We observe hysteresis in the high-frequency (5–15 Hz) seismic noise level relative to
the associated hydrological parameters. In addition, our seismic noise analysis reveals an asymmetry and a
high coherence in noise cross-correlation functions for several station pairs during the typhoon passage,
which corresponds to sediment particles and turbulent flows impacting along the riverbed where the river
bends sharply. Based on spectral characteristics of the seismic records, we also detected 20 landslide/debris
flow events, which we use to estimate the sediment supply. Comparison of sediment flux between
seismologically determined bedload and derived suspended load indicates temporal changes in the sediment
flux ratio, which imply a complex transition process from the bedload regime to the suspension regime
between typhoon passage and off-typhoon periods. Our study demonstrates the possibility of
seismologically monitoring river bedload transport, thus providing valuable additional information for
studying fluvial bedrock erosion and mountain landscape evolution.

S

ediment transport and bedrock incision are critical parameters in the study of landscape evolution1–5 and
are needed for diverse applications including sedimentation engineering, river restoration, and flood
hazard mitigation. However, their assessment with traditional geomorphic methods is rarely possible.
For example, most measurement techniques (e.g., sediment traps) are in situ and cannot be used in extreme
flow conditions. Thus, no information is available during typhoon events when sediment is most mobile and
erosion processes are strongest.
A potential solution to this data gap is to use remote monitoring by geophones or seismometers that capture the
ground vibration caused by surface processes. In the last decade, seismic observations have been widely used to
study earth surface processes such as landslides6–8, rockslides9, rock falls10 and debris flows11, which we collectively
term ‘landquakes’
