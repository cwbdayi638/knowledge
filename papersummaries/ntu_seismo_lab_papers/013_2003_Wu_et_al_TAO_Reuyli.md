ABSTRACT
To improve location identification, we employed layered model joint
hypocenters determination (JHD) and double-difference earthquake location algorithm (hypoDD), three-dimensions velocity structure location
(3DLOC), and three-dimensions velocity structure with stations corrections
location (3DCOR) for the Rueyli, Taiwan, earthquake sequence. We found
that the 3DCOR can greatly improve the location identification precision
of the Rueyli earthquake sequence. The Rueyli mainshock was relocated to
23.510ºN, 120.660ºE at the depth of 5.6 km. The focal depth is significantly
deeper than the original CWBSN value of 2.8 km. Using this new location,
a first-motion fault-plane solution shows that this earthquake is a thrust
event with strike N53ºE, dip 42ºE, and rake 121º. Based on the hypocentral
distribution pattern ascertained after relocation and focal mechanism, the
Rueyli earthquake was probably caused by faulting in the Tachienshan
fault.

1. INTRODUCTION
The success of most seismological studies relies on the accuracy of earthquake locations.
The accuracy of the hypocenter locations is controlled by several factors, including the network geometry, available phases, arrival time reading accuracy, and knowledge of the crustal
structure.
Taiwan is located on the western Circum-Pacific seismic belt. The Philippine Sea plate
subducts northward under the Eurasia plate along the Ryukyu trench. The Eurasia plate sub1
