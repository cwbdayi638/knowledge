ABSTRACT
The earthquake early warning (EEW) system in Taiwan is the
outcome of rigorous research work carried out at various levels
after the occurrence of the 1986 Hualien earthquake that caused
destruction. After more than 25 years of development, three
different EEW systems exist in Taiwan. Currently, the nation wide
regional EEW system is operated by the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB), whereas, a hybrid (regional & onsite) system based on
Micro-Electro-Mechanical System sensors is run by National
Taiwan University (NTU). The third EEW (onsite system) is run
by the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering
(NCREE). Both CWB and NTU systems are capable of reporting
the EEW warnings within 20 seconds of earthquake occurrence.
The CWB system is incharge of providing earthquake alerts in
Taiwan via text message through mobile phone, TV, and directly
broadcasting system to schools and is providing earthquake alarms
to the general public since 2016. During recently damaging
earthquakes in Taiwan, the NTU system provided 2-8 seconds onsite
warning (lead time) in the blind zone around the epicenter. The
NTU system also can generate near real-time shake maps for rapid
response purposes. The NCREE system consists of about 98 stations
and can provide several seconds lead time in the area near the
epicenter. The NCREE system also can receive CWB regional
EEW messages for warning the regions away from the epicenter.
Individually every system has its advantage, however, the hybrid
approach will be one of the future systems for real operation.
INTRODUCTION
Taiwan is one of the leading countries to develop the earthquake
early warning (EEW) system. An EEW system is to identify ground
motion exceeding a certain threshold in the early stage of an earthquake
and alert the users before the arrival of strong ground shaking (Satriano
et al., 2011). Most of the EEW systems in the world detect an
earthquake and estimate its location and magnitude using real-time
seismic data and this information is adopted for calculating expected
ground motion at a particular
