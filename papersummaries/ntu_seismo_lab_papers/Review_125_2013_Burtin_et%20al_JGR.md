[1] Distributed activity of geomorphic processes with different spatiotemporal scales is

hard to monitor in detail with conventional methods but might be detected with
seismometers. From July to September 2010, we deployed 14 seismometers to evaluate the
ability of a two-dimensional array with small interstation distances (11 km) to continuously
monitor geomorphic processes in a mountain catchment (370 km2) in Taiwan. Spectral
analysis of seismic records highlights different sources with high-frequency content (>1 Hz),
consistent with hillslope and river processes. Using a common detection algorithm and a
location technique based on the timing of seismic amplitude, we have located 314 near-surface
events, most of which (69%) occurred during daily convective storms. Event activity was
positively correlated with the precipitation intensity, but this relation was not uniform in the
catchment. High-resolution satellite images and air photos did not show geomorphic change
during the study, which did not have any episodes of extreme precipitation. A majority of events
(61%) were collocated with preexisting geomorphic features (landslide scars, gullies) within the
uncertainty on location (9% of interstation distance). The combination of event location and
timing suggests a geomorphic source of recorded signals and most events had the seismic
characteristics of rockfall, debris avalanches, or slides. Reactivation of prior erosion sites by
such processes is difﬁcult to detect with imagery, but can possibly be resolved by seismic
monitoring. When proven, this approach will allow a spatially comprehensive survey of
geomorphic activity at the catchment scale, with temporal detail sufﬁcient to evaluate the exact
(meteorological) conditions under which process events occur.

Introduction

[2] Geomorphic processes as diverse as rockfall, landsliding,
debris ﬂow, and ﬂuvial sediment transport occur distributed
across landscapes under a range of external conditions. Their
individual rates and interactions together determine the sediment ﬂux from a landscape, the sensitivity and response of that
landscape to changes in external forcing, and the hazard risk
associated with erosion. To understand the mechanisms of
