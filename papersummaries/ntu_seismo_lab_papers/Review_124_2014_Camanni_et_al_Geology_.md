ABSTRACT
On 27 March 2013, a 6.2 ML earthquake occurred at 19 km depth in eastern Nantou, central
Taiwan. Over a 2 week period it was followed by more than 680 aftershocks that ranged to 5
ML. Most events occurred below the ~10-km-deep detachment fault predicted for this part of
the mountain belt, coinciding with other precisely located hypocenters that indicate that much
of the crust in this area is seismically active. We combine geological data with a three-dimensional (3-D) P-wave velocity model derived from local tomography and earthquake hypocenters to determine a model for the structure of central Taiwan. Much of the surface geology of
the area comprises the uplifted Eocene rocks of the Hsuehshan Basin. The 3-D P-wave velocity
model shows a shallowing of higher velocities across the Hsuehshan Basin and hypocenter
data indicate that its western bounding fault is clearly defined by an eastward-dipping band
of events that extends to >20 km depth. The eastern bounding fault is interpreted to coincide
at depth with a cluster of events between 20 and 30 km depth. These data suggest that the preexisting, rift-related extensional faults of the Hsuehshan Basin are currently being reactivated
and the basin is being inverted. We present hypocenter data from the Nantou sequence that
corroborate this interpretation and show the importance of choosing the correct structural
model when assessing seismic risk.
INTRODUCTION
In an arc-continent collision orogeny such as
that of Taiwan, the development of a foreland
fold-and-thrust belt depends, among other factors, on the thickness profile of the subducting
margin crust, the presence and size of the rift
basins within it, and the geometry of the platform and slope sedimentary sequences prior to
collision (Brown et al., 2011; Harris, 2011). The
response of these primary factors to the deformation is determined, to a large degree, by the
rheology of the crust, the orientation of the rift
basins and their bounding faults relative to the
plate convergence vector, and the convergence
rate (Sibson, 1995; Poblet and Lisle, 2011).
Many foreland fold-and-thrust belts worldwide (Rodgers, 1990; Poblet and Lisle, 2011)
include a deformed sedimentary cover of a rifted continental margin (Fig. 1A) that is detached
above the underlying basement (basement is defined here as any pre-rift rocks), often within or
at the base of the lowermost postrift sediments,
to form what is termed a thin-skinne
