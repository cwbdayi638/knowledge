Earthquake early warning (EEW) has been implemented in several regions around the world. However, because
of natural randomness and uncertainty, false alarm and missed alarm can be expected in EEW. The key scope of
this study is to evaluate the reliability of an on-site EEW in Taiwan, by testing the system's algorithm with
17,836 earthquake data from 1999 to 2013. The analysis shows that the on-site EEW system, empirically
speaking, should have a false-alarm probability of 2.5%, and a missed-alarm probability of 14.1%. Considering
missed alarm should be more critical to EEW, a new algorithm that could reduce the system's missed-alarm
occurrences to 6% is also discussed in this paper.

1. Introduction
The region around Taiwan is known for high seismicity. As a result,
a variety of earthquake studies were conducted for the region, including
earthquake early warning [1–5]. Understandably, the working principle of earthquake early warning (EEW) is to send out warning
messages to the public a few seconds before the arrival of peak ground
shaking, utilizing the nature that radio waves can travel much faster
than seismic waves [6]. Nowadays, EEW has been established in
several regions around the world, including Taiwan, Japan,
California, Mexico, Romania, and Turkey [7–16].
For example, Japan Railways ﬁrst developed an alarm system along
the tracks in the 1960 s to stop/deaccelerate moving trains immediately as long as the precursor threshold was exceeded by early earthquake motions [7]. By the current EEW characterizations, such a
system is within the scope of on-site EEW, which relies on the
precursor information detected at one site for EEW decision-making
for the same site. On the other hand, the Japan Meteorological Agency
(JMA) developed a diﬀerent EEW approach by deploying a number of
instrumentations along the east coast of Japan in an attempt to
“dissect” occurring earthquakes in the oﬀshore areas as early as
possible (i.e., interpreting its magnitude and location). Then if the
system judges a big earthquake is occurring, the information will be
immediately sent out to high-speed trains with immediate deceleration
in order to lower derailing likelihood as peak motions arrive [11]. But
unlike the previous on-site system, the JMA system is referred to as a
