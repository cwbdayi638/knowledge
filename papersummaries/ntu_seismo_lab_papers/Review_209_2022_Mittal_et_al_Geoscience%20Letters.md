REVIEW

Progress on the earthquake early warning
and shakemaps system using low‑cost sensors
in Taiwan

Abstract
Building an earthquake early warning (EEW) network requires the installation of seismic instruments around the
seismogenic zone. Using low-cost sensors to build a seismic network for EEW and to generate shakemaps is a costeffective way in the field of seismology. The National Taiwan University (NTU) network employing 762 P-Alert low-cost
sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology is operational for almost the last 10 years in
Taiwan. This instrumentation is capable of recording the strong ground motions of up to ± 2 g and is dense enough
to record the near-field ground motion. The NTU system has shown its importance during various earthquakes
that caused damage in Taiwan. Although the system is capable of acting as a regional as well as an onsite warning
system, it is particularly useful for onsite warning. Using real-time seismic signals, each P-Alert device provided a 2–8 s
warning time for the near-source earthquake regions situated in the blind zone of the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
regional EEW system, during the 2016 Mw 6.4 Meinong and 2018 Mw 6.4 Hualien earthquakes. The shakemaps plotted
by the P-Alert dense network help to assess the damage pattern and act as key features in the risk mitigation process.
These shakemaps are delivered to the intended users, including the disaster mitigation authorities, for possible relief
purposes. Currently, the P-Alert network can provide peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV),
spectral acceleration (Sa) at different periods, and CWB intensity shakemaps. Using shakemaps, it is found that PGV is a
better indicator of damage detection than PGA. Encouraged by the performance of the P-Alert network, more instru‑
ments are installed in Asia-Pacific countries.

Introduction
Taiwan is located in one of the seismically most active
regions of the world. The ongoing collision between the
Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate poses a serious threat of large to devastating earthquakes in Taiwan
(Fig. 1). On average, Taiwan witnesses one damaging
earthquake every year and a severe earthquake every
10 years. Earthquakes are inevitable and our inability
