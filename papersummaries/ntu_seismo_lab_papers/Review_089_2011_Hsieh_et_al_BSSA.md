Short Note
Source Uncertainty Estimation in Seismic Intensity
Determination of the Taiwan Region
by Chih-Yih Hsieh, Ting-Li Lin, Yih-Min Wu, and Da-Yi Chen*

Abstract

In this work, we quantify the effect of source uncertainties, other than
earthquake magnitude and location, in rapid seismic intensity determinations in
Taiwan using the strong-motion accelerograms recorded by stations of the Taiwan
Strong-Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP) between 1991 and 2010. We find
that rapid earthquake reporting assumes that a point source has an uncertainty of 0.5°
in intensity and 7:2 cm=s2 in peak ground acceleration (PGA). Therefore, these values
can be regarded as the upper bound for precision in the Taiwan rapid reporting
system (RRS).

Introduction
maps. With over a decade of developments and improvements, the TREIRS system is now integrated into the realtime strong-motion network in Taiwan, which is a part of
the rapid reporting system (RRS). The RRS is implemented
based on the real-time Central Weather Bureau Seismic
Network (CWBSN, Hsiao et al., 2011), and consists of more
than 100 digital telemetered seismic stations (Fig. 1).
The rapid estimation of seismic intensity adopted in the
RRS is based on the relation between intensity and PGA (Hsu,
1979; Wu et al., 2002), using the following relationship:

Seismic intensity is an indicator that describes the level
of ground shaking and the severity of damage at a specific
site. By definition, seismic intensity is assessed from the
response of people to shaking or from in-situ observations of
structural damage in the hours or days following a damaging
earthquake. For rapid emergency response, such as resource
dispatch management, information regarding the spatial distribution of seismic intensity is practically useful, and a near
real-time or quick damage assessment in terms of seismic
intensity is greatly in demand. One practical way to fulfill
this demand is to correlate seismic intensity with peak
ground motions because they can be acquired in near real
time via a rapid reporting system (RRS).
Taiwan, which is located on the western circum-Pacific
seismic belt, is situated in the collision boundary zone between the Philippine Sea plate (PSP) and the Eurasian plate
(EP). The entire island of Taiwan is under a northwestsouthwest compression with an approximate plate convergence rate of about 8 cm=yr (Yu et al., 1997). As a result,
seismicity in Taiwan is considerably high. As the population
and the economy grow, Taiwan has been constantly threatened by large, devastating earthquakes, as demonstrated by
the catastrophic 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake.
For rapid reporting of felt earthquakes within Taiwan, a
real-time strong-motion network, the Taiwan Rapid Earthquake Information Release System (TREIRS), has been
operated by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) since 1997
(Shin et al., 1996; Wu et
