Key Points:

• W
 e use a template matching method
to rebuild an earthquake catalog
for Taiwan 7 months before and
12 months after 2009 typhoon
Morakot
• The seismicity rate of a 40-day
earthquake sequence in northeastern
Taiwan was reduced significantly after
the passage of Morakot
• The seismicity rate increased slightly
but without clear b-value change after
Morakot in typhoon-driven landslide
zone in southern Taiwan

Abstract Recent studies suggested that transient and long-term stress changes caused by Earth's surface
processes (e.g., extreme weather events, annual variations on groundwater storages) can affect earthquake
activities in the subsurface. However, these studies may be limited by the completeness of standard earthquake
catalogs, especially during or right after extreme weather events. Here we apply the template matching method
to build a more complete earthquake catalog in Taiwan spanning seven months before and 12 months after
2009 typhoon Morakot, which brought the highest rainfall in southern Taiwan in the past 60 years and triggered
numerous landslides. We then use the enhanced catalog to investigate possible influences of typhoon-driven
Earth's surface processes (atmospheric pressure, precipitation, and e
