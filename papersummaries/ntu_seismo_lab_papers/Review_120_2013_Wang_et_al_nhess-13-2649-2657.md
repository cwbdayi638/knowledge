Abstract. Earthquake size can be described with different
magnitudes for different purposes. For example, local magnitude ML is usually adopted to compile an earthquake catalog, and moment magnitude Mw is often prescribed by a
ground motion model. Understandably, when inconsistent
units are encountered in an earthquake analysis, magnitude
conversion needs to be performed beforehand. However, the
conversion is not expected at full certainty owing to the
model error of empirical relationships. This paper introduces
a novel first-order second-moment (FOSM) calculation to estimate the annual rate of earthquake motion (or seismic hazard) on a probabilistic basis, including the consideration of
the uncertain magnitude conversion and three other sources
of earthquake uncertainties. In addition to the methodology, this novel FOSM application to engineering seismology is demonstrated in this paper with a case study. With
a local ground motion model, magnitude conversion relationship and earthquake catalog, the analysis shows that the
best-estimate annual rate of peak ground acceleration (PGA)
greater than 0.18 g (induced by earthquakes) is 0.002 per
year at a site in Taipei, given the uncertainties of magnitude
conversion, earthquake size, earthquake location, and motion
attenuation.

Introduction

The size of earthquakes can be portrayed with different magnitudes, such as local magnitude ML and moment magnitude
Mw . For example, the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan

reportedly had a local magnitude of 7.3 and a moment magnitude of 7.6. Understandably, the difference is attributed to
definitions and measurements. For local magnitude ML , it
is based on the largest amplitude on a Wood–Anderson torsion seismograph installed at a station 100 km from the earthquake epicenter (Richter, 1935). In contrast, moment magnitude Mw is related to the seismic moment of earthquakes, the
product of fault slips, rupture areas, and the shear modulus
of the rock (Keller, 1996).
Nowadays, local magnitude ML is commonly adopted by
earthquake monitoring agencies, mainly because the measurement is relatively straightforward and its indication to
the shaking of buildings is robust (Kanamori
