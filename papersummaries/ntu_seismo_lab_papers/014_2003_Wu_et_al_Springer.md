Abstract
An efficient earthquake auto-location algorithm
has been developed by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), Taiwan. The CWB can now routinely obtain earthquake information in one
minute after the occurrence of an earthquake
using this new algorithm. In order to take full
advantage of this capability, four automatic information broadcast media, namely, e-mail,
World Wide Web, FTP server and pager system,
have been configured to receive and transmit
automatically the earthquake information from
the CWB seismic monitoring system. This new
automatic earthquake information broadcast
system will enable the CWB to disseminate information about felt earthquakes even more
quickly and widely than its current practice
through the fax and paper reports.

1 Introduction
Interest in rapid access to earthquake information had grown enormously in the past few
years. In addition to satisfying the public and
media needs, the rapid notification programs
provide valuable information for rapid earth-

quake disaster response, thereby mitigating the
loss. Recognizing the importance of rapid
earthquake information for seismic hazard mitigation, efforts to design and implement systems to provide rapid earthquake information
have expanded over the last 10 years. Recently,
a real-time strong-motion network was installed in the Taiwan area by the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) for monitoring purposes. In order to maximize the use of data
from this network, a rapid earthquake information and early warning system is under active
development. A rapid response information release system for large earthquakes in Taiwan
has been implemented CWB through a Taiwan
Rapid Earthquake Information Release System
(TREIRS). In this paper, we shall describe the
instrumentation and system performance of the
TREIRS.

2 Instrumentation
The CWB of Taiwan has deployed a modern digital accelerograph network. The network headquarters receives a continuous digital data
stream input from 58 strong-motion stations
(Fig. I) on a real-time basis. At a digitization
rate of 50 samples/sec, three channels of
strong-motion data take up the 4800-baud band
of the CWB leased telephone lines, whereas an
additional 4800-baud band is used for transmitting short-period velocity data. A group of PC
respectively operates under MS-DOS, Windows/
95, and Windows/NT system for data acquisition, p
