a b s t r a c t
The ﬁrst local magnitude scale (ML) for Northern Vietnam has been derived using a portable broadband
seismic network in Northern Vietnam as part of the cooperation between the Vietnam Institute of Geophysics and the Institute of Earth Sciences at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The composite horizontal peak
amplitude data used in this study is comprised a total of 202 amplitude records from 14 broadband stations, which measure 36 shallow earthquakes with focal depths less than 36 km, occurred in and around
north-western Vietnam during 01/2006–10/2007. The new distance-correction function obtained in this
study is  log A0 ¼ 1:74 logðrÞ þ 0:00048r  0:522; where A0 and r are the empirically determined distance correction and hypocentral distance, respectively. This distance-correction relation for Northern
Vietnam is quite similar to one for southern California, implying relative efﬁcient attenuation with distances. The correlation between the new ML and duration magnitudes (Md), which is still being used
for making the ofﬁcial earthquake bulletin in Vietnam, is expressed as M L ¼ 0:955Md þ 0:17:

1. Introduction
Vietnam, located in South East Asia, is bounded by the Paciﬁc
and Mediterranean–Himalayan seismic belts on its eastern, and
western and southern sides, respectively. Seismicity in Vietnam
is considered to be moderate and mostly occurs in north-western
Vietnam. Most of the main faults in Northern Vietnam are NW–
SE-trending, strike-slip faults, and are regarded as the south segment of the Red River Fault. Over recent decades, the economy of
Vietnam has rapidly grown and infrastructure and buildings have
being constructed in many cities and provinces of Northern Vietnam. Despite the fact that the seismicity in Northern Vietnam is
known to be moderate, one of the major steps for a developing
region are seismic hazard assessments for the sake of hardening
the building design code and urban development plans, which
undoubtedly require more effort and attention.
