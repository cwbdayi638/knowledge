SUMMARY
To improve the resolution in imaging the 3-D VP and VP /VS structures in the Taiwan region,
especially offshore eastern Taiwan, we combine the arrival times from eleven ocean bottom
seismometers (OBSs) and from seismic stations of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)
with those from the permanent stations of Taiwan Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network
(CWBSN) and Taiwan Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (TSMIP). By doing so, we
have obtained a new 3-D tomographic model for Taiwan and its surrounding regions with
a better resolution, especially in the area offshore northeastern Taiwan. We also used this
new tomography model to relocate the hypocentres of the earthquakes in northeastern Taiwan
and determined the focal mechanisms of relatively large events. Our tomography results
indicate that in the region northeast of Taiwan, the subducting oceanic Philippine Sea Plate
beneath the Eurasian continental lithosphere is characterized by a high VP layer, surrounded
by lower VP areas. This P-wave velocity characteristics of the subducting slab provides a better
constraint on the geometry of the subduction interface, especially in its shallower portion. In
the hangingwall (Eurasian) block above the subduction interface, a vertically elongated high
VP /VS body appears to originate from the interface at depths between 100 and 140 km. We
suggest that it represents the partially melted materials that are related to the magmatic activity
of the Ryukyu volcanic arc.

A good understanding of the 3-D seismic structure is a very important foundation for a variety of earthquake research topics, such
as earthquake relocation, earthquake source study and seismotectonic investigations. In the area of Taiwan, an active collision zone
between the Eurasian and the Philippine Sea plates, a detailed 3-D
velocity model is crucial to the understanding of the active structural characteristics and the t
