Landslides are large rapid mass movement of the Earth surface under gravitational force, which are responsible for more than 340
fatalities each month worldwide (Petley et al. 2009). Thus, landslide risks have become an important issue in global natural hazard mitigation effort. Conventional seismic data analysis offers a
unique approach to studying landslides that is independent of and
complementary to other types of data. There are two distinct advantages provided by seismic monitoring: the abilities to detect remote
events and to determine the occurrence times. Precision in occurrence time determination is helpful to analysing the temporal characteristics of landslides (e.g. rainfall-induced landslides). Landslide
source mechanisms have been studied in detail for decades using
long-period seismic signals (Kanamori & Given 1982; Eissler &

Kanamori 1987; Dahlen 1993; Brodsky et al. 2003). They concluded that the source mechanism of landslides can be represented
by a nearly horizontal single forces or shallow horizontal thrust
faults. They also demonstrated that landslides can generate longperiod seismic signals propagating over long distances. Recently,
Favreau et al. (2010) and Moretti et al. (2012) conducted numerical modelling of landslide dynamics and seismic wave generation with realistic topography to discriminate different flow scenarios and estimate the rheological parameters. They showed that
the low-frequency source function (the spatio-temporal variation
of the basal stress field) of a landslide is a force with horizontal
and vertical components. Lin et al. (2010) analysed long-period
(20–50 s) regional seismic records and located the landslides and
submarine slumps during the Typhoon Morakot which hit Taiwan in
2009 August. Long-period signals may not be suitable for real-time

SUMMARY
We detected 12 landquakes in Taiwan with collapse areas between 0.27 and 2.48 km2 associated
with rock collapse, rockslide and debris and/or rock avalanche during the passage of Typhoon
Morakot in 2009. These events
