Magnitude determination using cumulative
absolute absement for earthquake early
warning

Abstract
The cumulative absolute absement (CAA) of the 3 s window after P-wave arrival can be used to estimate the mag‑
nitude (MCAA) of an earthquake. This method can achieve good results even when only the six stations nearest
to the epicenter are used. The standard deviation between the estimated CAA magnitude (MCAA) and the moment
magnitude (Mw ) is found to be 0.3 when using either 6 or 20 stations. This means that MCAA can be reliably predicted
using the closest 6 stations. On the other hand, the magnitude (MPd ) derived from Pd using the closest 20 stations
has a standard deviation of 0.4 between the estimated MPd and Mw . This suggests that CAA is a better magnitude
determination parameter for the EEW system than Pd.

Introduction
Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems play a crucial role in providing advance alerts before the arrival
of strong ground shaking following a destructive earthquake. These systems send out alerts within a few seconds, enabling people to take immediate action and save
lives before the arrival of damaging S-waves. On-site
EEW relies on the initial P-wave signals from a single station or a small array to rapidly determine the intensity of
the destructive S-waves. Regional EEW systems, on the
other hand, utilize seismic data from multiple stations
near the epicenter to estimate the earthquake’s intensity,
location, and magnitude. Regional EEW systems offer

greater accuracy compared to on-site EEW. One of the
key challenges in EEW is the quick and accurate estimation of earthquake magnitude using the early seismic signals (P-waves) recorded by a limited number of stations
close to the epicenter (Mittal et al. 2022). Traditional
approaches involve analyzing the amplitude and frequency (period) parameters of the initial P-waves for this
purpose (Nakamura 1988; Kanamori 2005; Wu and Zhao
2006). Noteworthy period parameters for rapid magnitude estimation include the average period (τc ) and the
maximum dominant ground motion period (τpmax ). These
period parameters are employed because the frequency
information conveyed by the initial seconds of P-waves
exhibits high sensitivity to the final magnitude while
being less affected by the attenuation of seismic waves
