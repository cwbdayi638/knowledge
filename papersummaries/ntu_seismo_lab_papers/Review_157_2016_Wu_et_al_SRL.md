Performance of a Low-Cost Earthquake Early
Warning System (P -Alert) during the 2016
M L 6.4 Meinong (Taiwan) Earthquake

ABSTRACT
On 5 February 2016, a moderate earthquake occurred in
southwestern Taiwan with M L 6.4 and a focal depth of
16.7 km. This earthquake caused damage to a few buildings
and 117 casualties. A low-cost earthquake early warning
(EEW) system (P-alert) is in operation for the purpose of
EEW and for providing near-real-time shake maps. During this
event, a detailed shaking map was generated by the P-alert system within 2 min after the earthquake occurrence, and the
high shaking regions strongly correlated with the locations
in which the damage and casualties occurred. In the field, individual P-alert devices also serve as onsite EEW systems using
P-wave information. The individual P-alert provided a
4–8 s lead time before the arrival of violent shaking in the
damaged regions. For regional EEW, both the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB, official agency) and the P-alert system responded very well. Currently, regional warnings in Taiwan
are only provided to cities at epicentral distances of 50 km
or more by the CWB. For cities within a 50-km epicentral
distance, the P-alert system could be useful for providing onsite
EEW. The performance of the P-alert network during this
earthquake proves the efficiency of this real-time, low-cost network in terms of early warning (regional and onsite), near-realtime shake maps, rapid reports, and strong-motion data for
research purposes.

From the viewpoint of regional seismotectonics, the recent
moderate earthquake on 5 February 2016 could be associated
with earthquakes in the second category occurring on active
faults in western Taiwan. According to the source parameters
issued by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) rapid reporting
system (Wu et al., 1997, 2000), the earthquake was located in
the Meinong District of Kaohsiung city, ∼28 km northeast of
Pingtung City in southern Taiwan (Fig. 1) at a focal depth of
16.7 km. The focal mechanism of this event has been reported
by the Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS) and
the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), both of which suggest a

INTRODUCTION
Taiwan is perhaps one of the most seismically active regions in
the world due to the collision of the Eurasian plate (EP) and
the Philippine Sea plate (PSP; Tsai et al., 1977; Wu et al.,
2008) and is continuously threatened by large and devastating
earthquakes. Numerous earthquakes of magnitude 4 and above
occur every year inland and off the east coast of Taiwan island.
Some damaging events have inflicted severe casualties and
property losses. These earthquakes can be divided into those
associated with the northward subduction of the PSP under the
EP and those associated with active faults in western Taiwan
(Wu et al., 1999).
