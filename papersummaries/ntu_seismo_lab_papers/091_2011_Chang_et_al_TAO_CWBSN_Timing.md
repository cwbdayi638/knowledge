ABSTRACT
Timing is a key factor for an earthquake monitoring system and may affect the determination of earthquake location and
related studies. In this work, we examined the telemetry delay within the Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN)
from 1991 to 2011 and found that the timing systems, at most of the stations in the CWBSN, could contain an approximate
0.2 sec telemetry delay. Based on our results, the telemetry delay was found to cause a 0.2 sec shift in earthquake origin times
during the earthquake location process. However, the delay may not cause a significant difference in earthquake location
results.
Key words: Earthquake, Seismic network, Earthquake location, Taiwan

1. INTRODUCTION
Taiwan, an island located in the western portion of the
Pacific Rim seismic belt, is one of the most seismically active regions in the world. Along the Ryukyu trench located
in the eastern portion of the island, the Philippine Sea plate
subducts northward under the Eurasian plate. Off the southern tip of the island, the Eurasian plate subducts eastward
under the Philippine Sea plate (Fig. 1). The CWBSN is the
system responsible for earthquake monitoring in Taiwan,
and records approximately 18000 events each year in a
region of roughly 400 × 550 km (Shin 1992). Serious and
damaging events, occurring over the past few decades, have
been recorded and carefully studied (Wang and Shin 1998;
Chang et al. 2000, 2007; Teng et al. 2001; Wu et al. 2003,
2008; Huang et al. 2008; Lin 2010; Huang et al. 2011). The
CWBSN provides a wealth of earthquake records relating to
studies surrounding Taiwan.

In earthquake monitoring, system timing is a key factor for determining earthquake location. The CWBSN is a
real-time system. Signals from field stations are transferred
to central stations via leased telephone lines and earthquake
times are stamped by the central station. The data transferring procedure results in a telemetry delay for the timestamps
marked in each record. Generally, the telemetry delay is
roughly 0.2 sec differe
