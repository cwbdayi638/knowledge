Earthquake early warning systems have been developed to help minimize the loss of life and other
damages resulting from catastrophic earthquakes. In the past several decades, these systems have
evolved to function using a variety of methodologies. This study introduces an onsite system developed
from a correlation between the precursor measurement (Pd3) and the peak ground acceleration (PGV)
from 780 historical earthquake events recorded in Taiwan, Japan and South California. The study
analyzes and integrates the uncertainty of the onsite system, establishing the statistical relationship
between the PGV forecast, the Pd3 precursor, and the exceedance probability (PE). A method is
presented for forecasting the PGV by scaling the Pd3. Furthermore, this study also suggests a
decision-making model to determine whether or not the early warning notiﬁcation should be issued,
based on factors such as the uncertainty of the early warning system, the magnitude of the precursor,
and warning recipient characteristics.

1. Introduction
Catastrophic earthquakes can be devastating to human populations, as demonstrated by the 2010 Haiti earthquake with a
reported magnitude of 7.0 and which resulted in an estimated
death toll of more than 150,000. To help reduce the dreadful
consequences of catastrophic earthquakes, the scientiﬁc community is working on better understanding the factors creating these
disasters and on what can be done to mitigate future damage.
Such work requires learning more about the mechanisms that
generate earthquakes, improving our abilities to predict earthquakes, and expanding the use of hazard mitigation methods,
including the development and implementation of earthquake
early warning systems.
This study examines the uncertainty of one speciﬁc onsite
model that uses the relationship between the ﬁrst three second
peak displacement (Pd3) as a precursors to aid in the prediction of
the peak ground velocity (PGV) [1]. The paper includes an overview of the early warning system and provides a statistical
evaluation
